43	SAFETY & SECURITY		\N	<h1><strong>TIPS FOR A SAFE TRAVEL ABROAD</strong></h1>\n<h2><strong>1. Security &amp; Health.</strong></h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Check with your doctor and insurance carrier</strong>: Double-check to make sure that you have all of the proper vaccinations and that you have renewed all essential prescriptions. Get a letter from your doctor for medications you are bringing. Some countries have strict laws, even against over-the-counter medications, so read about your destination before you go.</li>\n<li><strong>Read up on your destinations.</strong> Learn about visa requirements, local laws, customs, and medical care in the countries you are visiting. Some travelers, such as those with disabilities, women, LGBTI persons, may face additional challenges when abroad.</li>\n<li><strong>Bring copies of your passport</strong>: if your passport gets stolen or lost, you want to be sure that you can still get back into the country, or be able to prove your citizenship.</li>\n<li><strong>Have important emergency contacts with you</strong>: local police and fire stations, nearby hospital or medical center, a local cab company, any other numbers you may need.</li>\n<li><strong>Do not pet stray animals</strong>: even if you are an avid dog-lover, what may seem like a pet to you could be very dangerous animal in another country. Romania, Thailand and Ethiopia are just a few countries struggling with stray dogs and other animals that have mauled and killed people.</li>\n<li><strong>Don&rsquo;t use shortcuts</strong>: even if you are starting to feel comfortable in a new city, do NOT try and find a shortcut just to lessen your travel time. Get the travel guide and keep your walk safe.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><strong>2. Money.</strong></h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Look up the monetary conversion before you go</strong>: make sure you do your math before you travel to get a sense of where the conversion rate is at.</li>\n<li><strong>Make sure your credit card will work in the country you&rsquo;re visiting</strong>: Europeans banks have switched almost completely to the more secure chip-and-PIN technology, and fewer businesses abroad are accepting the outdated magnetic-strip cards.</li>\n<li><strong>Go to a bank or ATM in the country you&rsquo;re visiting</strong>: the conversion centers in the airport or around the city tend to be hug rip-offs. You won&rsquo;t get charged as many fees at the ATM or the bank, and the conversion will be exact.</li>\n<li><strong>Always have local cash:</strong> Not every place takes credit cards. Especially important places like trains or buses.</li>\n<li><strong>Call your bank or credit card provider</strong>: sometimes banks think that fraud may be occurring if transactions are suddenly happening in the U.S when you&rsquo;re from Australia, and they will turn off your card as a security measure.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><strong>3.

21	Miami		\N	<h1><strong>MIAMI</strong></h1>\n<p><strong>I. General Information</strong></p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>1. Introduction</strong></p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;">A little more than a century ago, a city sprung up almost overnight. As a result, one of Miami&rsquo;s many nicknames is the Magic City. Much like its geographical description, Miami is surging as a major international port and a gateway for global industries establishing footholds in the U.S.</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;">With great year-round weather, top-ranked beaches and the sparkling waters of Biscayne Bay as the backdrops for a cosmopolitan metropolis and pulsing rhythms of diversity, Miami is definitely sitting on top of the bucket&rsquo;s lists of destination to visit.</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>2. History of Foundation</strong></p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The Miami area was inhabited for thousands of years by Indigenous cultures. The Tequestas had been there with their village of hundreds of people dating back to 500-600 B.C at the mouth of the Miami River. Later, Juan Ponce de Leon was the first European to visit in 1513 and Spain is credited for the first recorded landing in 1566. Shortly after the Spanish rule established a mission on the river&rsquo;s north bank, the Tequestas were targeted for conversion to Christianity. The attempt failed and a majority of the tribe, disease-stricken with small pox and other illnesses died.</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The attack of the United States land expansion to displace and relocate American Indians brought large migrations of Native Americans around the late 1700&rsquo;s to South Florida. After Florida was ceded to the United States and purchased from Spain in 1819, three major wars were waged by the Seminoles against the U.S. Government. The Miami area was devastated by the second ward and was known as one of the worst events in American history. These wars attributed for the slow settlement of Miami until 1842.</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Then, William English charted the &ldquo;Village of Miami&rdquo; and the village was established on the south bank of the Miami River. One the north side of the river, Julia Tuttle, a wealthy widow from Ohio, purchased a large citrus plantation in addition to a plot she inherited. She had envisioned the City as a gateway for international trade. By April 1896, the railroad tracks reached Miami and in July a meeting was held to incorporate the city. The right to vote was restricted to men and a third of the voters were Bahamian immigrants. The City was incorporated in 1896 with 444 citizens under the name of &ldquo;The City of Miami&rdquo;.</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Along with the railroad, Flagler financed and built streets, water and power systems and a resort hotel. Canals were made to drain water from the everglades that covered a majority of the land. It was no surprise that Miami soon became an instant tourist attraction and retreat for the rich and famous. This prompted the first of many real estate booms.</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;">In 1959, the Cuban dictator Fidel Castro came to power. What followed was a mass exodus of people from Cuba to Miami. Hundreds of thousands of Cubans came to Miami thinking it to be a temporary home until their home was freed from its communistic reign. An invasion of Cuba was planned by the U.S., which became known as &ldquo;The Bay of Pigs&rdquo;, but was disrupted when the Soviet Union threatened the U.S. with warfare. Since the late 1960&rsquo;s, Miami has become a mix of cultural influences &ndash; with mainly Cubans, African-American, and Caribbean.</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>3. Area &amp; Population</strong></p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The City of Miami is located in Southeast Florida in Miami-Dade County on the Miami River, between the Florida Everglades and the Atlantic Ocean. The main portion of the city lies on the shores of Biscayne Bay which contains several hundred natural and artificially created barrier islands, the largest of which contains Miami Beach and South Beach. The Gulf Stream, a warm ocean current, runs northward just 15 miles (24 km) off the coast, allowing the city&rsquo;s climate to stay warm all year.</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Miami is partitioned into North, South, West, and Downtown sections. The heart of the city is Downtown Miami and is technically on the eastern side of the city.&nbsp; Downtown is home to many major banks, courthouses, financial headquarters, cultural and tourist attractions, schools, parks, hospital and medical research centres, and a large residential population. The southern side of Miami includes Coral Way, The Roads and Coconut Grove. The south is where a lot of nightclubs, bars, restaurants and bohemian shops are located. Therefore, it is very popular with local college students. The western side of Miami includes Little Havana, West Flagler, and Flagami, and is home to many of the city&rsquo;s traditionally immigrant neighbourhoods. The northern side of Miami includes Midtown, a district that has a great mix of diversity with West Indians, Hispanics, European Americans, bohemians, and artists. The wealthier residents usually live in the north-eastern part, in Midtown, the Design District, and the Upper East Side.</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The Miami metropolitan area has a population of more than 5.5 million people, ranked seventh largest in the United States, and is the largest metropolitan area in the South-eastern United States. As of 2010, 69.96% of the population are Hispanic that mainly of Cuban origin, 16% are African-American, 11.92% are White, and 1.85% are of Asian ancestry.</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>4.

In 1925, newspaper magnate William Randolph Hearst purchased the Cloisters and the monastery's outbuildings, dismantled them stone by stone in Spain, packed the pieces in more than 11,000 wooden crates, and shipped them to the United States.

Gastronomy</strong></p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>1. Must-eat in Miami</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Arepas:</strong> think a flattened, pancake like grilled cheese and add some Colombian and Venezuelan flare. Arepas are made with a maize-like dough, stuffed with cheese, most commonly, and cooked until the dough reaches a golden brown. (at <em><u>La Latina Miami - 3509 NE 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33137</u></em>)</li>\n<li><strong>Biskits</strong>: a honey, apple cider glaze and a dash of Maldon. (at <em><u>The Fed - 5132 Biscayne Blvd, FL 33137</u></em>)</li>\n<li><strong>Caf&eacute; con Leche y Tostada Cubana</strong>: Nothing gets more simple, or classic, than cafe con leche and grilled bread. Similar to a cafe latte, the brew is instead made with Cuban coffee, an intense dose of espresso with what will seem like equal parts sugar. The buttered, Cuban bread can then be eaten alongside or dunked in the coffee to for a sweet and creamy pick-me up. (at <em><u>David&rsquo;s Caf&eacute; - 8718 SW 40th St, Miami, FL 33165</u></em>)</li>\n<li><strong>Ceviche</strong>: One of the most versatile dishes, ceviche consists of three parts: fish, acid, spice. Anything else is strictly embellishment. This Peruvian dish has been transformed into an American staple and is a must have for every menu card along a coastline. It's as classic Miami as white linen pants. (at <em><u>My Ceviche Brickell - 1250 S Miami Ave, Miami, FL 33130</u></em>)</li>\n<li><strong>Croquetas</strong>: Ham, cheese, chorizo, and chicken can all be found stuffed within Miami's best croquetas. Technically anything that is a minced or smashed into a small disk or cylinder then breaded and fried is a croqueta. Surprisingly enough, this includes crab cakes and mozzarella sticks. In Miami, you can find them in restaurants and bakeries just as often as you can along boardwalks.</li>\n<li><strong>Cuban Mojo</strong>: In Miami, Cuban mojo is on piled on everything. Most commonly made with garlic, sour orange juice, and occasionally olive oil, the sauce can act as a marinade for&nbsp;barbecuing or even a condiment in sandwiches that adds a zesty, garlic kick.</li>\n<li><strong>Cuban Sandwich</strong>: Miami&rsquo;s most iconic dish. A true collaboration between Cuban migrant workers and Floridians in the late 1800s and the early 20th century, this spin on the old ham and cheese is most often found simply with fresh Cuban bread, yellow mustard, roasted pork, baked ham, Swiss cheese, and sliced dill pickles.&nbsp;(at <em><u>Versailles Restaurant - 3555 SW 8th St, Miami, FL 33135</u></em>)</li>\n<li><strong>Deviled Eggs</strong>: a perfect snack menu item that takes a boring hard-boiled egg up several notches and transforms it into a delicious and delicate dish. The precisely cooked egg yolk is removed from the egg white and classically mixed with mayonnaise, Dijon mustard, lemon juice, and a touch of hot sauce. Once the mixture is complete, it is pipetted back into the egg white &lsquo;casing,&rsquo; ready to be served. (at <em><u>Michael&rsquo;s Genuine Food &amp; Drink - 130 NE 40th St, Miami, FL 33137</u></em>)</li>\n<li><strong>Fritas</strong>: a Cuban take on burger that has national appeal. A little spiced, ground beef, a little mojo, a few onions, and some shoestring potatoes, you have a frita. If it's a good enough grab for Obama while visiting the Magic City, then it's a good enough grab for you. (<em><u>at El Mago de las Fritas - 5828 SW 8th St, West Miami, FL 33144</u></em>)</li>\n<li><strong>Mofongo</strong>: a Puerto Rican speciality that is as beloved in Miami as it is in its hometown, featuring a small mountain made of fried plantains, garlic, and chicharrones that have all been smashed and molded together in a wooden mortar and pestle known as a pilon. Different variations can be made by adding seafood, chicken, pork, or broth.</li>\n<li><strong>Stone Crab Claws</strong>: Served cracked and chilled on ice, Florida Stone Crab claws can vary in size between 2.75 inches length to over a colossal 2 pounds. The&nbsp;sweet, lobster-esque meat needs little seasoning, yet is still&nbsp;classically served with hash browns, cole slaw, lemon, and mayo, butter, or tartar sauce. (at <em><u>Joe&rsquo;s Stone Crab - 11 Washington Ave, Miami Beach, FL 33139</u></em>)</li>\n</ul>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>2. Iconic Local Dinning</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><em><u>In the city:</u></em>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>15th &amp; Vine Kitchen and Bar</strong>: this restaurant and bar offers a vibrant culinary experience that is reflective of the cultural tapestry of Miami.

22	New Orleans		\N	<h1><strong>NEW ORLEANS</strong></h1>\n<p><strong>I. General Information</strong></p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>1. Introduction</strong></p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;">New Orleans is one of the world&rsquo;s most fascinating cities. It is home to a truly unique melting pot of culture, food and music. Moreover, New Orleans neighborhoods are where the culture and creativity of the Crescent City come to life. From the historic French Quarter to the elegant Garden District to the music-filled Marigny- there is great food, music and more to be found all across the city. Not only that, the city is also famous for its annual celebrations and festivals, most notably Mardi Gras, dating to French colonial times. Maybe that&rsquo;s why the New Orleans is often referred to as the &ldquo;most unique&rdquo; city in the United States.</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>2. History of Foundation</strong></p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Situated on a bend of the Mississippi River 100 miles from its mouth, New Orleans has been the chief city of Louisiana and the Gulf of Mexico&rsquo;s busiest northern port since the early 1700s. Founded by the French, ruled for 40 years by the Spanish and bought by the United States in the 1803 Louisiana Purchase, New Orleans is known for its distinct Creole culture and vibrant history.</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The first known residents of the New Orleans area were the Native Americans of the Woodland and Messapian cultures. The expeditions of De Soto (1542) and La Salle (1682) passed through the area, but there were few permanent white settlers before 1718, when the governor of French Louisiana, Jean-Baptiste Le Moyne, Sieur de Bienville, founded the city of Nouvelle-Orleans on the first crescent of high ground above the Mississippi&rsquo;s mouth. In 1722 he transferred Louisiana&rsquo;s capital from Biloxi. The same year a hurricane destroyed most of the new city, which was rebuilt in the grid pattern of today&rsquo;s French Quarter.</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;">In 1762 and 1763 France signed treaties ceding Louisiana to Spain. For 40 years New Orleans was a Spanish city, trading heavily with Cuba and Mexico and adopting the Spanish racial rules that allowed for a class of free people of color. The city was ravaged by fires in 1788 and 1794 and rebuilt in brick with buildings and a cathedral that still stand today. In 1803 Louisiana reverted to the French, Napol&eacute;on Bonaparte then sold it to the United States 20 days later in the Louisiana Purchase. The final battle of the War of 1812 was fought in defense of New Orleans; Colonel Andrew Jackson led a coalition of pirates, free blacks and Tennessee Volunteers to defeat a British force outside the city.</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;">During the first half of the 19<sup>th</sup> century, New Orleans became the United States&rsquo; wealthiest and third-largest city. Its port shipped the produce of much of the nation&rsquo;s interior to the Caribbean, South America and Europe. Thousands of slaves were sold in its markets, but its free black community thrived. Until 1830, the majority of its residents still spoke French.</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;">At the start of the Civil War, New Orleans was the largest city in the Confederacy but it was only a year until Union troops, having captured its downriver defenses, political force, as emancipated slaves and free people of color were brought into the political process and, with the 1870s rise of the White League and the Ku Klux Klan, forced black out of it. Although the rise of railroads made shipping on the Mississippi less essential than it had been, New Orleans remained a powerful and influential port.</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;">By 1900, the city&rsquo;s streetcars were electrified, and New Orleans jazz was born in its clubs and dance halls. They city grew. New pump technology drove the ambitious draining of the low-lying swampland located between the city&rsquo;s riverside crescent and Lake Pontchartrain. New levees and drainage canals meant that many residents could live below sea level. Hurricanes in 1909, 1915, 1947 and 1965 damaged the city, but never catastrophically.</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;">After World War II, suburbanization and conflicts over school integration drew many white residents out of the city, leaving a core that was increasingly African-American and impoverished. Despite these social changes, the city grew as a tourist attraction, with hundreds of thousands of annual visitors drawn to its Mardi Gras festivities and to the culture that had inspired playwright Tennessee Williams, trumpeter Louis Armstrong and chef Jean Galatoire.&nbsp;</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>3. Area &amp; Population</strong></p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;">New Orleans is located on the banks of the Mississippi River, approximately 105 miles (169 km) upriver from the Gulf of Mexico. According to the U.S Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 350 square miles (910&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>), of which 169 square miles (440&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>) is land and 181 square miles (470&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>) (52%) is water. Orleans Parish is the smallest parish by land area in Louisiana.</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The city is located in the Mississippi River Delta on the east and west banks of the Mississippi River and south of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Pontchartrain">Lake Pontchartrain</a>. The area along the river is characterized by ridges and hollows.</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;">A recent study notes that 51% of New Orleans is at or above sea level, with the more densely populated areas generally on higher ground. The average elevation of the city is currently between one and two feet (0.5&nbsp;m) below sea level, with some portions of the city as high as 20 feet (6&nbsp;m) at the base of the river levee in Uptown and others as low as 7 feet (2 m) below sea level in the farthest reaches of Eastern New Orleans.</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The Central Business District of New Orleans is located immediately north and west of the Mississippi River, and was historically called the &ldquo;American Quarter&rdquo; or &ldquo;American Sector&rdquo;. It was developed after the heart of French and Spanish settlement. It includes <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lafayette_Square,_New_Orleans">Lafayette Square</a>. Most streets in this area fan out from a central point in the city. Major streets of the area include <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canal_Street,_New_Orleans">Canal Street</a>, Poydras Street, Tulane Avenue and Loyola Avenue. Canal Street functions as the street which divides the traditional "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downtown_New_Orleans">downtown</a>" area from the "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uptown_New_Orleans">uptown</a>" area.</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;">New Orleans has a population of approximately 344,000 people with 60.2% of the population is African-American, 33% of Whites, 5.2% are of Hispanic/ Latino heritage, 2.9% of the population is from Asian ancestor, and 0.9% from American Indian and Alaska Native, while the 1.7% rest are people with two or more races.</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>4.&nbsp;</strong><strong>Facts &amp; Figures</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>New Orleans is known to be the place where Voodoo was introduced in to the U.S: One of the most prominent figures of New Orleans was Marie Laveau, an oracle who performed numerous exorcisms and voodoo rituals and who became widely known as the Voodoo Queen back in the 1800s.</li>\n<li>New Orleans and the surrounding areas were sold to Napoleon: At the beginning of the 19th century, both New Orleans and all the surrounding areas were sold to Napoleon Bonaparte during what was known as the Louisiana Purchase. This is one of the reasons why the city became one of the most important multicultural areas in the United States.</li>\n<li>The city has the highest number of historic districts: According to the National Register, New Orleans has no less than 20 historic districts, more than other cities in the US.</li>\n<li>New Orleans is home to the longest continuous bridge in the world, according to the Guinness Book of World Records &ndash; Lake Pontchartrain Causeway.</li>\n<li>The New Orleans Superdome is the largest enclosed arena in the world.</li>\n<li>The home of Poker: New Orleans is widely considered to be the birthplace of both poker and craps.</li>\n<li>New Orleans is famous for in terms of gastronomy, that is certainly the Creole Cuisine! Jambalaya and King cake to die for!</li>\n<li>New Orleans is the place where Jazz was born: along with two other music genres related to it &ndash; rock &amp; roll and blues.</li>\n<li>Most people regard New Orleans as the home of the Mardi Gras festival, but the truth is that the parade originates in the city of Mobile, Alabama.</li>\n<li>The first opera in the United States of America was performed in the 1790s in New Orleans.</li>\n<li>New Orleans is known as the most haunted city in America: it is believed to be the place with the highest spiritual activity in the US, especially around the French Quarter where Marie Laveau used to live.</li>\n<li>New Orleans is the birthplace of famous singers like Louis Armstrong, writers like Truman Capote as well as TV personalities like Reese Whiterspoon and Ellen DeGeneres.</li>\n<li>The city was initially created as a shelter from hurricanes: it was believed that New Orleans would be a safe place from hurricanes and it was initially built in a rectangle block (now known as the French Quarter).</li>\n</ul>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>5. Weather</strong></p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The climate of New Orleans is humid subtropical, with short, generally mild winters and hot, humid summers. The monthly daily average temperature ranges from 53.4&nbsp;&deg;F (11.9&nbsp;&deg;C) in January to 83.3&nbsp;&deg;F (28.5&nbsp;&deg;C) in July and August. The average precipitation is 62.5 inches (1,590&nbsp;mm) annually; the summer months are the wettest, while October is the driest month.</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Hurricanes pose a severe threat to the area, and the city is particularly at risk because of its low elevation, because it is surrounded by water from the north, east, and south; and because of Louisiana's sinking coast. According to the Federal Emergency Management Agency, New Orleans is the nation's most vulnerable city to hurricanes.</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>6. Transportation</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Streetcars:</strong> There are three different lines: St. Charles, Canal Street, and the Riverfront, each of them originates downtown but takes you different parts of the city.

Attractions</strong></p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>1. Haunted New Orleans</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><em><u>The Bourbon Orleans Hotel</u></em>: a notable haunted hotel in the French Quarter. When the building was a convent, the Orleans Ballroom was host to quadroon balls, where men would court local ladies. One ghost is reported to be weeping in the corner for her lover who had promised to marry her but never returned. A male spirit enjoys the company of female visitors, often leaving ladies feeling that the unseen is too close for comfort. The ghosts of children and nuns who perished in a yellow fever epidemic are often seen by guests, particularly the spirit of a little girl rolling her ball down the sixth floor corridor. Additionally, spirits have been known to borrow guests' belongings. One couple received a shock when they found their camera contained pictures of the pair sleeping.</li>\n<li><em><u>Hotel Monteleone</u></em>: While the hotel is most famous for the literary figures it has housed since its establishment in 1886, some of the guests never departed the grand hotel. In March of 2003, the International Society of Paranormal Research made contact with more than a dozen spirits, including a former employee named William Wildmere who died of natural causes in the hotel. Additionally, the spirit of a boy enjoys playing hide-and-seek with another young boy on the fourteenth floor.</li>\n<li><em><u>&ldquo;Cities of the Dead&rdquo;:</u></em> Since the city is below sea level and it doesn't take much digging to hit water, New Orleanians bury their dead above ground. These tombs are often lauded for their architecture, but bodies are not all that reside here. Visitors have heard screams coming from inside tombs and seen the ghosts of cats and dogs. Most famously, St. Louis Cemetery No. 1 is home to Marie Laveau's tomb and is considered the most haunted cemetery in the U.S. Marie Laveau herself is rumored to traipse around the graves mumbling a Santeria curse at trespassers. Voodoo legend says to knock three times on the face of Laveau's grave, mark three X's, knock three times again and make a wish to be blessed by Laveau. Don&rsquo;t forget to leave an offering when you go.</li>\n<li><em><u>Le Petit Theatre</u></em>: America's oldest community theater, is also a haven for the dead. When actors have lost something, they call out to Caroline, one of their most active resident ghosts, asking where it is. When the actors leave the room and return, the item will be sitting in the middle of the floor. An actress who fell from the catwalk onto the stage is sometimes seen up on the catwalk while the curtain billows of its own accord. With 11 confirmed spirits, including ex-managers, Union soldiers and servants, the theater is chilling when the lights dim for a show.</li>\n<li><em><u>Lafitte&rsquo;s Blacksmith Shop</u></em>: the oldest building used as a bar in the United States, built between 1722 and 1732. Between 1722 and 1791, the building was used as a smuggling post by pirates Jean and Pierre Lafitte and called a "Blacksmith Shop" to avoid suspicion by authorities. With such a storied history, it's no surprise that the bar is one of the most haunted in America. Visitors often report that the fireplace has a pair of glowing red eyes in the grate, and Jean Lafitte himself is rumored to haunt the building. People have seen him sitting at a table in the back of a piano bar, drink in hand.</li>\n</ul>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>2. Museums</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><em><u>Louisiana&rsquo;s Civil War Museum</u></em>: one of the largest repositories of Confederacy-related artifacts and memorabilia in the United States, in addition to being the oldest continuously operating museum in Louisiana. The Louisiana Historical Association built the museum in 1891, and its exterior sandstone construction and cathedral-like appearance stand out in contrast to its more recent surroundings on the edge of New Orleans&rsquo; Warehouse Arts District.</li>\n<li><em><u>The National World War II Museum</u></em>: The country's official World War II Museum lets you experience America's role in the war and on the Home Front - from the 1930s prelude to war, to the Normandy Invasion and the battles of the Pacific Islands. At The US Freedom Pavilion: The Boeing Center, see how technological innovations aided the Allies. Then, with Beyond All Boundaries - a multi-sensory cinematic feature from producer Tom Hanks, playing at the 4D Solomon Victory Theater - feel and experience what soldiers at the front experienced.

Pinch the sides of the shell and pop off the head, and then suck the sweet, spicy tail flesh. (best at Felix&rsquo;s Restaurant &amp; Oyster Bar &ndash; 739 Iberville Street, New Orleans, LA 70130)</li>\n<li><em><u>Jambalaya</u></em>: jambalaya is a traditional Creole dish that combines rice with vegetables and some type of meat, usually chicken and andouille sausage &mdash; think of jambalaya as the Crescent City's version of paella.

10	Boston		\N	<h1><strong>BOSTON</strong></h1>\n<p><strong>I. General Information</strong></p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>1.&nbsp;</strong><strong>Introduction</strong></p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Boston is the capital and the largest city of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts in the United States. It is one of the oldest and most historic cities in North America with a very European feel. Boston is extremely diverse with cultures, as well as some of the top universities on the planet &ndash; primarily in technology, health care and finance. Boston is a unique city where one must visit when exploring America.</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>2. History of Foundation</strong></p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Boston was founded on the Shawmut Peninsula in 1630 by Puritan settlers from England. Many of the crucial events of the American Revolution - such as the Boston Massacre, the Boston Tea Party, Paul Reverse&rsquo;s midnight ride, the battles of Lexington and Concord and Bunker Hill, the Siege of Boston, and many others &ndash; occurred in or near Boston. After the Revolution, Boston&rsquo;s long seafaring tradition helped make it one of the world&rsquo;s wealthiest international ports, with the slave trade, rum, fish, salt, and tobacco being particularly important.</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The Embargo Act of 1807, adopted during the Napoleonic Wars, and the War of 1812 significantly curtailed Boston&rsquo;s harbour activity. Manufacturing became an important component of the city&rsquo;s economy, and by the mid-19<sup>th</sup> century, the city&rsquo;s industrial manufacturing overtook international trade in economic importance. Until the early 20<sup>th</sup> century, Boston remained one of the nation&rsquo;s largest manufacturing centres and was notable for its garment production and leather-goods industries. During this period, Boston flourished culturally as well, admired for its rarefied literary life and generous artistic patronage, with members of old Boston families &ndash; eventually dubbed Boston Brahmins &ndash; coming to be regarded as the nation&rsquo;s social and cultural elites.</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;">By the early and mid-20<sup>th</sup> century, the city was in decline as factories became old and obsolete, and businesses moved out of the region for cheaper labour elsewhere. Boston responded by initiating various urban renewal projects under the direction of the Boston Redevelopment Authority (BRA), which was established in 1957. However, its extensive demolishing project to improve the historic West End neighbourhood was met with strong public opposition.</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Boston was an intellectual, technological and political centre but has lost some important regional institutions, including the loss to merges and acquisitions of local financial institution such as FleetBoston Financial in 2004. Boston-based department stores Jordan Marsh and Filene&rsquo;s have both been merged into the Cincinnati-based Marcy&rsquo;s.&nbsp; The city has experienced gentrification in the latter half of the 20<sup>th</sup> century, with housing prices increasing sharply since the 1900s. Living expenses have risen, making Boston one of the highest costs of living in the United States.</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Boston, however, ranks high on liveability ratings, raking 36<sup>th</sup> worldwide and sitting in the top 3 most liveable large cities in the United States (with San Francisco and Seattle) in 2015.</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>3. Area &amp; Populations</strong></p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Boston has an area of total 89.6 square miles (232.1 km&sup2;). 54% of the city is land and the 46% is of water. The highest point in Boston is Bellevue Hill at 330 feet (100m) above sea level, and the lowest point is at sea level. Situated onshore of the Atlantic Ocean, Boston is the only state capital in the contiguous United States with an oceanic coastline.</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Boston is surrounded by the &ldquo;Greater Boston&rdquo; region and is contiguously bordered by the cities and towns of Winthrop, Revere, Chelsea, Everett, Somerville, Cambridge, Newton, Brookline, Needham, Dedham, Canton, Milton, and Quincy.</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The iconic Charles River separates Boston from Watertown and the majority of Cambridge, and the mass of Boston from its on Charlestown neighbourhood.</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Boston is sometimes called a &ldquo;city of neighbourhood&rdquo; because the profusion of diverse subsections; the city government&rsquo;s Office of Neighbourhood Services has officially designated 23 neighbourhoods. More than two-third of inner Boston&rsquo;s modern land area did not exist when the city was founded, but was created visa the gradual filling in of the surrounding tidal areas over the centuries.</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Downtown and its immediate surroundings consists largely of low-rise (often Federal style and Greek Revival) masonry buildings, interspersed with modern high-rises, notably in the Financial District, Government Centre, and South Boston.

You won&rsquo;t find any &ldquo;Happy Hour&rdquo; signs in the local Boston pub because the typical post-work drink deals have been banned since 1984.</li>\n<li>The Fig Newton (a favourite American sweet snack) is actually named after the Boston suburb of Newton, Massachusetts.</li>\n<li>Boston was home to the first U.S chocolate factory, which was built in the Lower Mills section in the Dorchester neighbourhood of Boston.</li>\n<li>Boston built America&rsquo;s first subway, the Tremont Street Subway, back in 1897.</li>\n<li>Boston was also home to the first public beach in the U.S, which was Revere Beach.</li>\n<li>In 1880, candlepin bowling was invented in Boston. Candlepin bowling is similar to the tenpin bowling most are familiar with, with a few key differences in equipment.</li>\n<li>You can drive 90 feet below the earth&rsquo;s surface in Boston, as the Ted Williams Tunnel is the deepest in North America, running nearly 90 feet underneath the earth&rsquo;s surface.</li>\n<li>Christmas was once banned.

18	Las Vegas		\N	<h1><strong>LAS VEGAS</strong></h1>\n<p><strong>I. General Information</strong></p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>1. Introduction</strong></p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Las Vegas, often known as Vegas, is a city in the United States, the most populous city in the state of Nevada, the county seat of Clark County, and the city proper of the Las Vegas Valley. &ldquo;What happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas!&rdquo;. Las Vegas called itself The Entertainment Capital of the World as it&rsquo;s famous for all the mega casino hotels, major resorts, extremely colourful nightlife and associated entertainment.</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The city is one of the top three leading destinations in the United States for conventions, business, and meetings. In addition, the city&rsquo;s metropolitan area has more AAA Five Diamond hotels than any other city in the world, and is a global leader in the hospitality industry. It&rsquo;s an understatement to say that today, Las Vegas is one of the top tourist destinations in the world.</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>2. History of Foundation</strong></p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The name Las Vegas comes from Spanish for &ldquo;the meadows&rdquo;. The land was originally the home to the Navajo and other nomadic American Indians. In 1829, a Mexican trader by the name of Antonio Armijo came across what he called a grassland meadow, hence the name Las Vegas for that area. In 1855, the Mormons sent a small group of settlers to help the local Indians plant crops and set up a safe way station between Los Angeles and Salt Lake City, but by 1857, the safe way station was abandoned.</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;">In 1905, the city of Las Vegas was established. In 1931, two things happened that would forever change Las Vegas and help to shape the city&rsquo;s future&rsquo;s path. The first thing was the construction on the Hoover Dam began, and thousands of workers were brought in to the city. At the same time, casino gambling was legalised. For years, the city struggled as a small town until Bugsy Siegel, the infamous New York mobster, opened his Flamingo Hotel in 1946.</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Following World War II, lavishly decorated hotels, gambling casinos and big-name entertainment became synonymous with Las Vegas. The 1950s saw the opening of the Moulin Rouge, the first racially integrated casino-hotel in Las Vegas. During the 1960s, corporations and business powerhouses such as Howard Hughes were building and buying hotel-casino properties. Gambling was referred to as &ldquo;gaming&rdquo;, which transitioned into legitimate business. In 1989, entrepreneur Steve Wynn changed the face of the Las Vegas gaming industry by opening up The Mirage, the Las Vegas&rsquo;s first mega-casino resort. The year 1995 marked the opening of the Fremont Street Experience in Las Vegas&rsquo;s downtown area. This canopied, five-block area features 12.5 million LED lights and 550,000 watts of sound from dusk until midnight shows help on the top of each hour, turned Vegas into a city that truly never sleeps.</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>3. Area &amp; Population</strong></p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Las Vegas is situated within Clark County in a basin on the floor of the Mojave Desert, and is surrounded by mountain ranges of all sides. Much of the landscape is rocky and arid with desert vegetation and wildlife. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 135.86 square miles (351.9 km&sup2;), of which 99.7% is land with a very small area covered with water. Within the city, there are many lawns, trees and other greenery. Due to water resource issues, there has been a movement to encourage conservation programs aiming to reserve water and landscape.</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Las Vegas has a population of approximately 603,500 people, with White takes up 47.9% of the population. Black or African American is 11.1% of the population, while Hispanic or Latino is 31.5%, Asian only 6.1%. The city&rsquo;s most populous group, non-Hispanic Whites, have proportionally declined from 87.6% in 1970 while Hispanic or Latino increased from 4.6% to 31.5% from 1970.</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;">According to a 2004 study, Las Vegas has one of the highest divorce rates, not wholly due to the Las Vegas themselves getting divorced but more because divorce is easier in Nevada than most other states &ndash; many people therefore go there for easier process. Similarly, Nevada marriages a notoriously easy to get. Las Vegas has one of the highest marriage rates of U.S cities, with many licenses issued to people from outside the area.</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>4. Fun Facts &amp; Figures</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Most of Vegas&rsquo;s iconic hotels aren&rsquo;t technically located in the city of Las Vegas. A good portion of the Las Vegas Strip &ndash; and the famed &ldquo;Welcome to Fabulous Las Vegas&rdquo; sign &ndash; are actually located in an unincorporated township called Paradise, Nevada.</li>\n<li>The strip&rsquo;s Flamingo Las Vegas Hotel and Casino got its name from founder &ndash; and legendary mobster &ndash; Bugsy Siegel&rsquo;s girlfriend. Actress Virginia Hill went by the nickname &ldquo;The Flamingo&rdquo; because of her red hair and long, thin legs.</li>\n<li>Vegas Vic &ndash; the oversized neon cowboy that presides over downtown&rsquo;s famed Fremont Street &ndash; it&rsquo;s the largest mechanical neon sign in the world.</li>\n<li>More than 41 million visitors cycle through Sin City each year, which might explain why the town boasts 14 of the world&rsquo;s 20 biggest hotels.</li>\n<li>There&rsquo;s a secret city underneath the city. Miles of tunnels &ndash; originally built to protect the desert town from flash floods.</li>\n<li>In May 1955, the Moulin Rouge made history when it became the city&rsquo;s first interracial casino.

(Hillier sold his golden nugget to the Golden Nugget for over a million dollars).</li>\n<li><strong>Bellagio Conservatory &amp; Botanical Garden</strong>: Each season, the enormously talented horticulturalists and designers who make up the Bellagio Conservatory team transform this 14,000-dquare-foot floral playground into a showcase of the distinctive sights and colours of spring, summer, fall, and winter-along with a special display for Lunar New Year.

Must-eat in Las Vegas</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>The riserva steak</strong>: Dry-aging is rightfully all the rage, but 60 days is for wusses. Carnevino does it the right way with the riserva&mdash;minimum <em>240-day</em> dry-aged steaks. The riserva displays the pungency of gorgonzola while conveying the essence of pure meat in every bite. After experiencing this, you&rsquo;ll never look at steak in the same way. (<em><u>Carnevino, at Palazzo, 789-4141</u></em><em>.)</em></li>\n<li><strong>Chicken fingers:</strong> Crispy, golden breading wraps impossibly moist chicken with wide bowls of hot sauce and ranch for dipping. (<em><u>Crown &amp; Anchor British Pub, 1350 E. Tropicana Ave., 739-8676; 4755 Spring Mountain Road, 876-4733</u></em><em>.</em><em>)</em></li>\n<li><strong>Hot N Juicy style shrimp</strong>: go with the shrimp Hot N Juicy style in a seasoning mix that combines all the other flavors for a garlicky, Cajun kick that will have you licking your fingers long after the last crustacean has disappeared into your belly. (<em><u>Hot N Juicy Crawfish, 4810 Spring Mountain Road, Suite C-D, 891-8889; 3863 Spring Mountain Road, 750-2428.</u></em><em><u>)</u></em></li>\n<li><em><strong>Consome loco and cochinita pibil tacos:</strong></em> <em>this authentic Mexican food, which is a </em>crazy-good chicken soup with rice, avocado and lime that&rsquo;s as comforting as anything your mother makes. Follow it with a pair of <em>cochinita pibil</em> tacos, spicy pork cooked in banana leaves and topped with pickled onions. (<em><u>Los Antojos, 2520 S. Eastern Ave., #B, 457-3505</u></em><em>.</em><em>)</em></li>\n<li><em><strong>Khao soi</strong></em><em>: </em>Coconut cream curry packs a sweet, mellow heat over egg noodles and your protein of choice, garnished with red onion, lime and pickled vegetables for some essential balance. (<em><u>Lotus of Siam, 953 E. Sahara Avenue #A5, 735-3033.</u></em><em><u>)</u></em></li>\n<li><em><strong>Honey toast</strong></em><em>: </em>a loaf of chewy white bread with the top lopped off, baked till the crust is crisp with butter and honey melted into its gooey center then topped with heavy scoops of vanilla ice cream. It&rsquo;s hot and cold, salty and sweet&mdash;the kind of simple, gratifying dessert that lingers long after you&rsquo;ve put down the spoon. (<em><u>Ichiza, 4355 Spring Mountain Road, 367-3151</u></em><em>.</em><em>)</em></li>\n<li><em><strong>Chicken fried lobster</strong></em><em>: </em>a large piece of lobster tail, breaded and fried, can hold its own with any steak or prime rib in the place. Along with a baked potato and the rest of the fixins, you&rsquo;ll be lucky if you can finish the whole meal. (<em><u>Binion&rsquo;s Ranch Steak House, at Binion&rsquo;s, 382-1600</u></em><em>.</em><em>)</em></li>\n</ul>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>2. Iconic Restaurants:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><em><strong>Michael&rsquo;s Gourmet Room:</strong></em> The best kept fine dining secret in Las Vegas, Michael&rsquo;s is super old school, with tuxedoed waiters and captains doing tableside presentations like deboning Dover Sole and igniting bananas Foster flamb&eacute;, while serving up hard to find forgotten classics like veal saltimbocca and Coquille St. Jacques &ndash; even the signature sorbet intermezzo is topped with Dom Perignon. Michael&rsquo;s has been doing its thing since 1979, and was the anchor for the late Barbary Coast Casino. It was relocated along with its most famous fixtures, an enormous entry door, the Tiffany glass domed ceiling, and its career waiters, to the South Point Resort, a large casino hotel catering mainly to locals and equestrians a few miles south of Mandalay Bay on Las Vegas Boulevard. It seats just 50 in plush banquets, dinner only, and to step in is to renter the city&rsquo;s Golden Age &ndash; it is absolutely worth the trip, though very expensive.</li>\n<li><strong>Sterling Brunch</strong>: always voted the city&rsquo;s best. it is one of the few &ldquo;champagne&rdquo; brunches in the country actually serving real champagne, Perrier-Jouet, unlimited and poured generously by excellent wait staff, along with bottomless mimosas and Bloody Mary&rsquo;s. The food signatures are whole lobster tails with drawn butter, the caviar station, and the raw bar with fresh shucked oysters. There is a lot more too, from Stone crab claws to rack of lamb, dim sum station, sushi station, hand carved meats and made to order desserts including crepes, all in an elegant setting. Anything that takes time, like eggs or desserts cooked to order, is delivered to your table, a really nice touch. Lots of brunch buffets boast omelette stations but how many serve up a house specialty omelette of lobster, cognac and boursin cheese?</li>\n<li><em><strong>Du-par&rsquo;s</strong></em><em>: </em>Most locals actually flock to this 24-hour coffee shop in the Golden Gate hotel downtown for its famously beloved pancakes, perennially rated the best in town, along with a vast slate of homemade pies. In true diner style, it has a huge menu, from breakfast to blue plate lunches to all sorts of dinner entrees, and a bakery list that goes on and on, but its classic status comes from one singular item, the shrimp cocktail. The Golden Gate was Las Vegas&rsquo; very first hotel (different name in 1906), and was assigned the first telephone number in Las Vegas (simply 1), sits at One Fremont Street, and among its many historic firsts was the 50-cent shrimp cocktail, launched in 1961 as part of a San Francisco/Fisherman&rsquo;s Wharf rebranding theme.</li>\n<li><strong>The Golden Steer</strong>: has been the place for beef since 1958, serving big steaks with classic steakhouse starters and sides like jumbo shrimp cocktail, crab cakes and hash browns, the place has a decidedly local, neighbourhood tavern feel, especially in its incongruously downscale bar room, complete with video poker. The Golden Steer is a high-end steakhouse, and not cheap, but noticeably less expensive than its Strip hotel and celebrity chef competitors.</li>\n<li><strong>Hugo&rsquo;s Cellar</strong>: sits in the bottom of the otherwise easy to overlook Four Queens casino in old Downtown. Its signature is a huge salad cart wheeled to the table where your salad is theatrically assembled to order. It has a more traditionally Continental style than the steak-centric Top of Binion&rsquo;s Steakhouse, another classic just down the street, with forgotten dishes like duck flamb&eacute; and seafood en papillote. There&rsquo;s a cozy cocktail lounge where they serve pate and crackers, nothing has changed here in forever, and locals pack the place, especially on weekends.</li>\n<li><strong>Top of Binion&rsquo;s Steakhouse:</strong> It is home to another old school classic steakhouse, predating the moon landing (and relocated within Binion&rsquo;s in 1994), on the top floor, reached by private elevator and boasting great views of Fremont Street. The menu is simple, with sides like iceberg wedge salad and creamed spinach anchoring a list of 28-day dry aged, grass-fed, corn-finished steaks, but there is a notable exception that puts the place on the map &ndash; the legendary one of a kind signature dish, Chicken Fried Lobster. Developed as a special dish for country music star Merle Haggard, it gained a cult reputation among cowboys visiting for the Rodeo world championships, and is now a staple. A large whole lobster tail is shelled, flattened, dredged in milk and flour, and then of course deep fried.</li>\n<li><strong>Peppermill</strong>: it is one of very few old freestanding restaurants on the Strip, not associated with any casino, and its past clientele is a Vegas Who&rsquo;s Who that includes Frank Sinatra and Jerry Lewis. It is within Vegas icons, where regulars and tourists flock side by side. This true classic has so much frozen in time atmosphere it has been used in many movies and television shows, from <em>Casino</em> to <em>CSI</em><em>.</em></li>\n<li><strong>Chicago Joe&rsquo;s:</strong> serving big portions of its hearty fare to deeply loyal local fans at very reasonable prices. Think linguine with clam sauce, spaghetti and meatballs, and eggplant, shrimp or chicken parmesan, all accompanied by rolls and a simple house salad with creamy Caesar.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em><strong>IV.

By that time, the Mirage was the most expensive casino with a total cost of about 630 million dollars. <strong>The construction contains a lot of gold, including the windows</strong><strong>, </strong>whose golden colour is a result of the gold dust that is used in the tinting process. The casino-hotel is considered the father and founder of today&rsquo;s conception of Las Vegas.</li>\n<li><strong>Caesars Palace</strong>: one of the top ten casinos in Las Vegas, situated on the west side of the Las Vegas Strip and is owned by Caesars Entertainment Corporation.

The pirate &lsquo;Buccaneer Bay&rsquo; show was replaced with &lsquo;Sirens&rsquo; Cove&rsquo; and &lsquo;The Sirens of TI&rsquo; in 2003. The show programmes included dancing, singing, half-naked pirates and many audio-visual effects, all of which were meant to attract adult audience. However, the show was stopped in 2013 due to construction.</li>\n<li><strong>Hard Rock</strong>: Owned and operated by Brookfield Asset Management and Warner Gaming, LLC, the 6,8-hectare property is situated on Paradise Road in Las Vegas. Its <strong>total gaming space is 2,800 square metres but gaming</strong> earns the resort only about thirty per cent of its income.

The resort was opened in the winter of 1996 as a Hawaiian-styled &lsquo;Project Paradise&rsquo; resort.

General introduction</strong></p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Los Angeles, LA, has long been associated with sunny days, fit people, relaxing lifestyle, nice beaches, beautiful celebrities and their million dollars&rsquo; mansions. LA is the entertainment capital of the world, a cultural mecca boasting more than 100 museums, and a paradise good weather. Los Angeles is on the leading edge of several growth industries. LA County, with more than 87,000 jobs in the fashion industry, has surpassed New York&rsquo;s fashion district workforce.</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>2. History of Foundation</strong></p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The history of Los Angeles begins some ten or twenty thousand years before the first Europeans arrived in Southern California. Throughout the vast majority of human history, there was no city of Los Angeles; for thousand years, hunters and gatherers clustered in villages on the shores and the banks of the rivers. Around 1769, when the first Mexican and Spanish settlers arrived, the basin was populated by the Cahuilla, Cupe&ntilde;o, Luise&ntilde;o, and Serrano, speakers of Takic languages, a branch of Northern Uto-Aztec.</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;">A permanent colonial settlement was established on 4<sup>th</sup> September 1781 as El Puelo de Nuestra Se&ntilde;ora de Nuestra Se&ntilde;ora de los Angeles di Porci&uacute;ncula. It was named in honour of the shrine to the Virgin Mary, Santa Maria degli Angeli, Our Lady of the Angels, on the plain below Assis, Saint Francis&rsquo; native village in Italy. The city was built in land on the Rio Porci&uacute;ncula, the broad river through the valley, rather than by the ocean, where it would have been too exposed to attacks. It was constructed in the traditional Spanish style, centered around a rectangle consisting of a city plaza, a guardhouse, a town house, and a granary. The invaders set out to reproduce the characteristic Spanish social arrangements and institutions: the missions, the presidios, the divisions between clergy, the army, and the civil populations. Soldiers and adventures, they married the indigenous women, tracking their offspring by degrees of intermarriage. The colonial imperative defined their agendas: the religious conversion of the indigenous people, the attempted pacification of natives&rsquo; hostile to colonization, the formation, training, and control of a labor force, and the defense of New Spain achieved its independence from the Spanish Empire in 1821, and the pueblo continued as a part of Mexico. During Mexican rule, Governor Pio Pico made Los Angeles Alta California&rsquo;s reginal capital.</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Mexican ruled ended during the Mexican-American War when Americans took control from the Californios after a series of battles, culminating with the singing of the Treaty of Cahuenga on 13<sup>th</sup> January, 1847. Railroads arrived with the completion of the Southern Pacific line to Los Angeles 1876. Oil was discovered in the city and surrounding area in 1892, and by 1923, the discoveries had helped California become the country&rsquo;s largest oil producer, accounting for about one-quarter of the world&rsquo;s petroleum output. In 1910, Hollywood merged into Los Angeles, with 10 movie companies already operating in the city at the time. By 1921, more than 80 percent of the world&rsquo;s film industry was concentrated in L.A. The money generated by the industry kept the city insulted from much of the economic loss suffered by the rest of the country during the Great Depression. By 1930, the population surpassed one million. In 1932, the city hosted the Summer Olympics.</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;">During WWII, Los Angeles was a major center of wartime manufacturing, such as shipbuilding and aircraft. Following the end of WWII, Los Angeles grew more rapidly than ever, sprawling into the San Fernando Valley. The expansion of the Interstate Highway System during the 1950s and 1960s helped propel suburban growth and signaled the demise of the city&rsquo;s electrified rail system, once the world&rsquo;s largest.&nbsp;</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;">In 1984, the city hosted the Summer Olympic Games for the second time. Despite being boycotted by 14 Communist countries, the 1984 Olympics became more financially successful than any previous, and the second Olympics to turn a profit until then &ndash; the other, according to an analysis of contemporary newspaper reports, being the 1932 Summer Olympics, also held in Los Angeles.</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Racial tensions erupted on 29<sup>th</sup> April, 1992, with the acquittal by a Simi Valley jury of the police officers captured on videotape beating Rodney King, culminating in large scale riots. They were the largest riots in US history causing approximately $1.3 billion in damage as well as 53 deaths and over 2,000 injuries.</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>3.

23	New York		\N	<h1><strong>NEW YORK</strong></h1>\n<p><strong>I. General Information:</strong></p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>1. General Introduction about the City: </strong></p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;">New York, New York, a city that never sleeps. Home to the Empire State Building, Times Squares, Statue of Liberty and so much more other iconic sites, the infamous New York city is a fast-paced, globally influential centre of art, culture, fashion and finance. The city of 5 boroughs site where the Hudson River meets the Atlantic Ocean, with the island borough of Manhattan at the &ldquo;Big Apple&rsquo;s&rdquo; core. New York city is a glamorous city where people around the world arrive every year to make their dreams come true.</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>2. History of foundation: </strong></p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;">In 1785, the assembly of the Congress of the Confederation made New York the national capital shortly after the war. New York was the last capital of the U.S under the Articles of Confederation and the first capital under the Constitution of the United States. In 1789, the first President of the United States, George Washington was inaugurated; the first United States Congress and the Supreme Court of the United States each assembled for the first time, and the United States Bill of Rights was drafted, all the Federal Hall on Wall Street. By 1790, New York had surpassed Philadelphia as the largest city in the United States.</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The Great Irish Famine brought a large influx of over 200,00 Irish immigrants living in New York by 1860, upwards of a quarter of the city&rsquo;s population. There was also extensive immigration from the German province, where revolutions had disrupted societies, and German comprised another 25% of New York&rsquo;s population in 1860.</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;">In 1898, the modern City of New York was formed with the consolidation of Brooklyn (until then a separate city), the County of New York (which then included parts of the Bronx), the County of Richmond, and the western portion of the County of Queens. The opening of the subway in 1904, first built as separate private systems, helped bind the new city together. Throughout the first half of the 20<sup>th</sup> century, the city became a world centre for industry, commerce, and communication.</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;">New York became the most populous urbanised area in the world in early 1920s, overtaking London. The metropolitan area surpassed the 10 million mark in the early 1930s, becoming the first megacity in human history. After World War II, New York emerged as the leading city of the world, with Wall Street leading America&rsquo;s place as the world&rsquo;s dominant economic power. The United Nations Headquarters was completed in 1952, solidifying New York&rsquo;s global geopolitical influence, and the rise of abstract expressionism in the city precipitated New York&rsquo;s displacement of Paris as the centre of the art world.</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The city and surrounding area suffered the bulk of economic damage and largest loss of human life in the tragic aftermath of the September 11<sup>th</sup>, 2001 attacks when the terrorist members of Al-Qaeda piloted American Airlines Flight 11 into North Tower of the World Trade Centre and United Airlines Flight 175 into the South Tower of the World Trade Centre, and later destroyed them, killing 2,192 civilians, 343 firefighters, and 71 law enforcement officers who were in the towers and the surrounding area. The rebuilding of the area, has created a new One World Trade Centre, and a 9/11 memorial and museum along with other new buildings and infrastructure. The new One World Trade Centre is the tallest skyscraper in the Western Hemisphere and the fourth-tallest building in the world by pinnacle height, with its spire reaching a symbolic 1,776 feet (541.3m) in reference to the year of American independence.&nbsp;</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>3. Area &amp; Population:</strong></p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;">New York city is situated in the Northeastern United States, approximately halfway between Washington D.C and Boston. The location at the mouth of the Hudson River, which feeds into a naturally sheltered harbour and the into the Atlantic Ocean, has helped the city grow in significance as a trading port. Most of New York City is built on the three islands of Long Island, Manhattan, and Staten Island.</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;">New York City is composed of five boroughs:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><u>Manhattan (New York County)</u></strong> is the geographically smallest and most densely populated borough. The islands are linked by bridges, tunnels and ferries. Manhattan is 13.4 miles long and 2.3 miles wide at its widest. Fifth Avenue divides the island into east and west sides. Manhattan&rsquo;s population density of 72,033 people per square mile (27,812/km&sup2;) in 2015 makes it the highest of any county in the United States and higher than the density of any individual American city. Manhattan is the cultural, administrative, and financial centre of New York City and contains the headquarters of many major multinational corporations, the United Nations Headquarters, Wall Street, and a number of important universities. Manhattan is often described as the financial and cultural centre of the world.</li>\n<li><strong><u>Brooklyn (Kings County):</u></strong> on the western tip of Long Island, is the city&rsquo;s most populous borough. Brooklyn is known for its cultural, social, and ethnic diversity, an independent art scene, distinct neighbourhoods, and a distinctive architectural heritage. Downtown Brooklyn is the only central core neighbourhood in the outer borough. The borough has a long beachfront shoreline including Coney Island, established in the 1870s as one of the earliest amusement grounds in the city. Marine Park and prospect Park are the two largest parks in Brooklyn.</li>\n<li><strong><u>Queens (Queens County):</u></strong> on Long Island north and east of Brooklyn, is geographically the largest borough, the most ethnicity diverse county in the United States, as well as the most ethnically diverse urban area in the world. Historically a collection of small towns and villages founded by the Dutch, the borough has since developed both commercial and residential prominence. Queens is the site of Citi Field, the baseball stadium of the New York Mets, and hosts the annual U.S Open tennis tournament at Flushing Meadows-Corona Park. Additionally, two of the three busiest airports serving the New York metropolitan area, John F. Kennedy International Airport and LaGuardia Airport, are located in Queens. (the third is Newark Liberty International Airport in Newark, New Jersey).</li>\n<li><strong><u>Staten Island (Richmond County)</u></strong> is the most suburban in character of the five borough. Staten Island is connected to Brooklyn by the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge and to Manhattan by way of the free Staten Island Ferry, a daily commuter ferry and popular tourist attraction which provides unobstructed views of the Statue of Liberty, Ellis Island, and Lower Manhattan. In central Staten Island, the Staten Island Greenbelt spans approximately 2,500 acres (10 km&sup2;), including 28 miles (45 km) of walking trails and one of the last undisturbed forests in the city. Designated in 1894 to protect the island&rsquo;s natural lands, the Greenbelt comprises seven city parks.</li>\n<li><strong><u>The Bronx (Bronx County):</u></strong> is New York City&rsquo;s northernmost borough and the only New York borough with a majority of it a part of the mainland Unites States. It is the location of Yankee Stadium, the baseball park of the New York Yankees, and home to the largest cooperatively owned house complex in the United States, Co-op City. It is also home to the Bronx Zoo, the world&rsquo;s largest metropolitan zoo, which spans 265 acres (1.09 km&sup2;) and houses over 6,000 animals. The Bronx is also the birthplace of rap and hip hop culture. Pelham Bay Park is the largest park in New York City, at 2765 acres (1119 ha)</li>\n</ul>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The city population in total is estimated to be around 8.5 billion in 2015</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>4. Facts &amp; Figures:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>New York is nicknamed as The Big Apple. In the early 1920s, &ldquo;apple&rdquo; was used in reference to the many horse racing courses in and around New York City. Apple referred to the prizes being awarded for the races (possibly due to the fact that horses like apples) as these were important races, the rewards were substantial. A writer of the New York Morning Telegraph, John Fitzgerald, referred to New York City&rsquo;s races &ldquo;Around the Big Apple&rdquo;. It is rumoured that Fitzgerald got the term from jockeys and trainers in New Orleans who aspired to race on New York City tracks, referring to the &ldquo;Big Apple&rdquo;.</li>\n<li>Except for emergencies, honking your car is actually illegal in New York City, and yes, everybody does it anyway.</li>\n<li>Manhattan was purchased from the native people in 1626 for the modern equivalent of 1000USD</li>\n<li>It can cost nearly $300,000 to operate a hot dog stand around Central Park. (maybe that&rsquo;s why) New Yorkers bite 10 times more people per year than sharks do.</li>\n<li>New York City doesn&rsquo;t have any Walmart&rsquo;s.</li>\n<li>More Chinese people live in New York City than any other city outside of Asia. And more Jewish people live there than any other city outside of Israel.</li>\n<li>25% of the world&rsquo;s gold bullion is stored in vaults under Wall Street (the Federal Reserve Bank)</li>\n<li>1 out of every 21 New Yorker is a millionaire</li>\n<li>With over 800 languages spoken by a significant portion of the population, New York City is the most linguistically diverse city in the world.</li>\n<li>The Empire State Building has its own zip code.</li>\n<li>Einstein&rsquo;s eyeballs are locked in a safe deposit box somewhere in the city.</li>\n<li>The city gets about 15 times more snow than the South Pole every year (because Antarctica is a desert and therefore receives very little precipitation).</li>\n<li>New York&rsquo;s Central Park is larger than the principality of Monaco.</li>\n<li>Annual location shots on the streets on New York number 40,000 &ndash; including commercials, feature films, television shows and series, music videos and documentaries.</li>\n<li>The Manhattan grid pattern produces an effect known as &ldquo;Manhattanhenge&rdquo; (like Stonehenge) as, on two days &ndash; around 28<sup>th</sup> May and around 12<sup>th</sup> July &ndash; sunset is directly aligned with the street grid pattern. (This means the sun can be seen setting exactly over the centreline of every Manhattan street).</li>\n</ul>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>5. Weather</strong></p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;">New York City features a humid subtropical climate. The city weather can vary from day to day, and even hour to hour, but a guide to the seasons can help you plan your wardrobe. More generally, spring in New York City brings budding flowers, light winds and rain, with the season&rsquo;s temperature ranging from chilly to warm. Winter are cold and damp, and prevailing wind patterns that blow offshore minimize the moderating effects of the Atlantic Ocean; yet the Atlantic and the partial shielding from colder air by the Appalachians keep the city warmer in the winder than inland North American cities. January is the coldest month with temperature ranging from 32.6 ᵒF (0.3 ᵒC) to 10 ᵒF (-12 ᵒC). Summers are typically warm to hot and humid, with a daily mean temperature of 76.5 ᵒF (24.7 ᵒC) to 90 &ndash; 100 ᵒF (32 &ndash; 38 ᵒC) in July.</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>6. Transportation</strong></p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;">New York is an excellent walking city, and getting around by foot is the best way to familiarise yourself with neighbourhoods and their divisions. Of course, sometimes you&rsquo;ll need to move more quickly or cover great distances, for which you&rsquo;ve got subways, buses and taxis at your disposal</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><u>Subways</u>:</strong> subway trains operate 24 hours a day, seven days a week. For $2.75 (the cost of a single ride when using a pay-per-ride MetroCard), you can use the system citywide and transfer to other subway lines as many times as you need, as long as you don&rsquo;t exit the system through a turnstile. You can also transfer from bus to subway or vice versa within two hours of using your MetroCard. The subway however does not travel to Staten Island. To get there, board the free Staten Island Ferry or take a bus.<br /><img src="/images/f.jpg" /></li>\n<li><strong><u>The Roosevelt Island Tram</u>:</strong> with the swipe of a MetroCard, the Roosevelt Island Tram gives you an aerial view of Midtown East along its path from 59<sup>th</sup> Street and Second Avenue in Manhattan to Roosevelt Island, located in the East River between Manhattan and Queens. The Tram got its start in the early 1900s, taking passengers halfway across the Queensboro Ridge, where an elevator would then transport them down the island.</li>\n<li><strong><u>Bike</u>:</strong> plenty of operations rent bikes by the half day and full day, with many such places located near the major biking destinations.</li>\n<li><strong><u>Ferry</u>:</strong>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>The Staten Island Ferry</strong> takes you on the route between Staten Island and Manhattan&rsquo;s Whitehall Ferry Terminal where you can enjoy the great views of the Statue of Liberty, New York Harbour and Lower Manhattan on the 25 minutes&rsquo; free mini cruise.</li>\n<li><strong>New York Water Taxi:</strong> another popular aquatic shuttle that takes you to Pier 84 (at 44<sup>th</sup> Street), Christopher Street, the World Financial Centre and Pier 1 in DUMBO.</li>\n<li><strong>NY Waterway:</strong> operates commuter ferries between points in Manhattan and New Jersey, and harbour and sightseeing cruises. The East River Ferry also provides a refreshing alternative to more traditional public transportation in the City with regular service to seven locations across the three boroughs.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong><u>Taxi</u>:</strong> yellow taxicabs and green Boro Taxis is regulated by the Taxi and Limousine Commission. Hotel doormen can hail a cab for you; a $1 tip is customary for this service. Tip 15-20% at the end of a trip; tolls are extra and added to the metered fare.</li>\n<li><strong><u>Helicopter</u>:</strong> seeing New York by air is an unforgettable experience. <em>Liberty Helicopters</em> (800-542-9933) runs several tours of the City; <em>Helicopter Flight Services, Inc</em>. (212-355-0801) will personalise sightseeing tours and charters; and <em>New York Helicopter Charter, Inc.</em> (212-361-606) allows you to choose from three options: the Liberty Tour, the Central Park Tour, and the Grand Tour, which combines the first two tours and also flies over many other essential NYC attractions.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>II. Attractions:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><u>Empire State Building</u>:</strong> located in the heart of Midtown Manhattan where you will have a journey through one of the most famous landmarks in the world, where you will experience the Art Deco lobby and murals, the historical &ldquo;Dare to Dream&rdquo; exhibit, and sustainability exhibit. On the 102<sup>nd</sup> floor, the Empire State Building&rsquo;s Top Deck gives you the most spectacular views of the city and beyond. Central Park comes into full view, the grid of streets reveals its brilliant design, and on a clear day you can see beyond the skyscrapers up to 80 miles away.</li>\n<li><strong><u>One World Observatory</u>:</strong> located in One World Trade Centre, the tallest building in the western hemisphere. The only one way to truly see the whole glamourous New York and look toward the horizon while enjoying some snacks and lighter fare at the three restaurants on the 101<sup>st</sup></li>\n<li><strong><u>Times Square:</u></strong> Flashing neon lights and giant digital billboards. Brilliant Broadway marquees. Costumed characters and musicians. Time Square is big, bright and unforgettable. Its main junction is filled with popular retailers-plus the TKTS discount booth, which offers up to 50% off theatre tickets. Walk to the top of its red steps-you may know them from the &ldquo;Empire State of Mind&rdquo; video-for a sweeping view of the area, including One Times Square, the building from which the ball drops on New Year&rsquo;s Eve. People-watchers will love the pedestrian-only zone furnished with tables and chairs.</li>\n<li><strong><u>Broadway</u>:</strong> the bright beating heart of NYC&rsquo;s performing arts scene. No visit to the City is complete without experiencing the rousing entertainment available in Midtown Manhattan&rsquo;s Theatre District, where dozens of historic venues stage bold new musicals, long-running hits and fascinating dramas every night of the week.</li>\n<li><strong><u>Central Park:</u></strong> the largest in Manhattan and without a doubt the most famous in all of NYC. Established in 1857, the 843-acre oasis has served as the scenic backdrop in countless movies and TV shows and functions as a kind of all-encompassing public recreation area. Its many attractions include a zoo, an ice-skating rink, a concert venue and several restaurants-not to mention its open fields, woodlands, running paths and various bodies of water. Located in the middle of Manhattan, the park, as its name suggests, is at the centre of it all.</li>\n<li><strong><u>The Met:</u></strong> on Fifth Avenue is one of NYC&rsquo;s most beloved cultural institutions. Housing nearly 2 million works of art, the Met is the largest museum in the US-and among the largest on earth. On a single day, you can see painting by Van Gogh and Rembrandt; 17<sup>th</sup> century Portuguese king&rsquo;s armour; ancient tapestries depicting Buddhist deities; and the Temple of Dendur, an Egyptian shrine built about 15 BC. You will also find galleries of Asian, Egyptian and Islamic art, which reveal the influences and intersections of the world&rsquo;s many cultures. In addition to the Met&rsquo;s main building on Fifth Avenue, the institution includes the Met Cloisters, dedicated to the art and architecture of medieval Europe, and the Met Beuer, featuring modern and contemporary collections.</li>\n<li><strong><u>The Museum of Modern Art (MoMA):</u></strong> not only devoted to presenting the best in contemporary art, but also to promoting the understanding of modern art and expanding the definition of what is considered &ldquo;art&rdquo; in the first place. See boundary-pushing modern work from the likes of Frida Kahlo, Andy Warhol, Pablo Picasso, Claude Monet and Vincent van Gosh (whose Starry Night is pictured here).</li>\n<li><strong><u>The Whitney Museum of American Art</u>:</strong> the world&rsquo;s leading museum of 20<sup>th</sup> century and contemporary art of the United States. Focusing particularly on works by living artist, the Whitney is celebrated for presenting important exhibitions and for its renowned collection, which comprises over 19,000 works by more than 2,900 artists. With a history of exhibiting the most promising and influential artists and provoking intense debate, the Whitney Biennial, the museum&rsquo;s signature exhibition, has become the most important survey of the state of contemporary art in the United States.</li>\n<li><strong><u>Rockefeller Centre:</u></strong> A visit to New York City wouldn&rsquo;t be complete without a trip to Rockefeller Plaza, where skaters glide across the rink and thousands of lights gleam from the always-enormous Christmas tree in the winter, and outdoor dining options abound in the warmer months. No matter the season, come for the shops (from the FDNY Fire Zone store and museum to Swarovski), the eats (from Dean &amp; DeLuca to Mendy&rsquo;s Kosher Deli) and the stargazing here in NBC Studios&rsquo; backyard. The three observation decks at Top of the Rock showcase the City&rsquo;s spectacular skyline.</li>\n<li><strong><u> Patrick&rsquo;s Cathedral:</u></strong> holds its own among Midtown&rsquo;s tall building and historic architecture, its twin spires jutting 330 feet up toward the heavens. Fresh off a $177 million restoration-which cleaned those spires as well as the heavy bronze doors, ceiling, stained glass and enormous pipe organ-the Neo-Gothic church is among NYC&rsquo;s most-visited religious sites; in fact, it&rsquo;s among the City&rsquo;s most-visited attractions period, welcoming an estimated 5 million people every year. On 24<sup>th</sup> September a very special guest will be among those annual arrivals: Pope Francis will preside over a private vespers prayer service, becoming the fourth pontiff to visit the cathedral. Spanning the length of an entire City block, the building itself is made of brick but entirely overlaid in marble. There&rsquo;s much to see once you pass through the bronze doors and stand under the vaulted ceiling, including a giant organ with 7,855 pipes, a becy of stained-glass windows, more than 20 altars-two of which were designed by Tiffany &amp; Co. &ndash; and a marble Stations of the Cross, which won recognition at the 1893 World&rsquo;s Fair in Chicago.</li>\n<li><strong><u>The Statue of Liberty:</u></strong> was a gift from France to the United States as a token of goodwill for America&rsquo;s centennial of independence (and to send a message to France&rsquo;s oppressive Second Empire). Historian Edouard de Laboulaye first proposed the idea in 1865, shortly after the Union won the American Civil War. He then teamed up with French sculptor Frederic Auguste Bartholdi, an admirer of the US, democracy and colossal monuments. When design Liberty Enlightening the World (the statue&rsquo;s official name), the duo were careful not to make Liberty appear to be &ldquo;leading an uprising&rdquo; but rather &ldquo;lighting the way, peacefully and lawfully&rdquo;, according to park service literature. They started construction in Paris in 1875 and shipped the completed pieces 10 years later, in 1885. On 28<sup>th</sup> October 1886, a million New Yorkers cheered the official dedication. Since then, the statue has been a symbol of freedom, justice and opportunity for those who come to New York City and America.</li>\n<li><strong><u>Yankee Stadium</u>:</strong> the home of the New York Yankees is one of the City&rsquo;s most beloved sports sites. The team&rsquo;s current address preserves many of the design details that defined the original place- The House That Ruth Built-where the baseball team played from 1923 until the new version opened for the 2009 season. The outfield stands still feature the Bleacher Creatures (very loud, very dedicated fans), but now there are fancy suites, a wider variety of concessions and a state-of-the-art video board. The stadium is also home to the New York City Football Club (soccer) and sometimes hosts other big events like concerts.</li>\n<li><strong><u>Madison Square Garden:</u></strong> The Garden is the city&rsquo;s premiere sports and entertainment complex, home to the New York Rangers, Knicks and Liberty teams, as well as the stage for massively popular artists like Tina Turner, AC/DC and Oasis. The more intimate Theatre at Madison Square Garden also hosts concerts and shows, such as Wintuk from Cirque de Soleil, and stand-up comedians like Chris Rock and Kathy Griffin.</li>\n<li><strong><u>Barclays Centre:</u></strong> Major-league sports at the corner of Atlantic and Flatbush Avenues have been a long time coming-since the 1950s, in fact-but the 18,2000-seat Barclays Centre is now a reality. Home to the Brooklyn Nets, the arena also features the more intimate 7,700-seat Tidal theatre, the Shops at Barclays Centre (including the Nets Lifestyle Shop by Adidas), and more than 50 local food vendors. In addition to the Nets, the Barclays Centre hosts college and prep basketball, boxing, hockey, circuses, family shows, and concerts ranging from Arcade Fire to Jay Z to Yanni.</li>\n<li><strong><u>Citi Field:</u></strong> The 42,000-seat venue echoes the design of Ebbets Field while also paying tribute to the baseball team&rsquo;s Polo Grounds and Shea Stadium heritage, which dates back to 1962. The Mets Hall of Fame and Museum, next to Jackie Robinson Rotunda, celebrates the organisation&rsquo;s history. From time to time, the stadium hosts major concerts-by the likes of Beyonc&eacute; and Foo Fighter-and other large non-baseball events.</li>\n<li><strong><u>Flushing Meadows Corona Park:</u> </strong>The largest park in Queens (and fourth largest park in all of New York City) has something for jocks, artists, nature lovers and the technologically inclined: green recreational spaces for baseball, soccer and cricket; playgrounds; skateboarding areas; handball courts; dog runs; the Queen Museum; the New York Hall of Science; the Queens Zoo, USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Centre (home of the US Open); and Citi Field, home to the Mets. Also the Unispehere, a symbol of diversity constructed for the 1964-1965 World&rsquo;s Fair, sit at the centre of Queen&rsquo;s primary green space.</li>\n<li><strong><u>Bronx Zoo:</u></strong> The Bronx Zoo of the Wildlife Conservation Society is the premier place to study and appreciate the world&rsquo;s many creatures. Home to more than 6,000 animals, the zoo spans 265 acres that re-create the diverse natural habitats of its numerous residents. You&rsquo;ll find the lemurs of Madagascar, gorillas of the Congo and snow leopards of the Himalayas, along with the denizens that stalk Tiger Mountain. Sea lion and penguin feedings are always visitors favourite.</li>\n<li><strong><u>Brooklyn Bridge:</u></strong> the bridge was designed by John A. Roebling, an immigrant from Prussia, though he died due to complications from a freak accident in 1869, just before construction commenced. His son Washington took over supervision, but a case of the bends sidelined him. Washington Roebling&rsquo;s wide, Emily, ultimately oversaw the balance of construction, which was completed in 1883; the bridge&rsquo;s dedication and opening took place in 24<sup>th</sup> May 1883. The bridge has been celebrated in song, glamourized on celluloid and immortalized in poetry, the postcard-perfect Brooklyn Bridge stands as one of New York City&rsquo;s most recognisable symbols &ndash; not to mention a magnificent feat of engineering. Upon its completion in 1883, it became the first roadway to connect Manhattan and Brooklyn. Back then, the Brooklyn Bridge was also the world&rsquo;s longest suspension bridge &ndash; its 1595-foot central span unsurpassed until the Williamsburg Bridge&rsquo;s completion two decades later. The bridge&rsquo;s appearance sets it apart: its Gothic towers with double arches, criss-crossing steel cables and graceful, gentle curvature make walking or biking across the span a sough-after experience for visitors.</li>\n<li><strong><u>The Staten Island Ferry:</u></strong> not only the way most New Yorkers and visitors travel between Manhattan and Staten Island, it is also an attraction unto itself. According to the Encyclopaedia of New York City, boat service between Staten Island and Manhattan dates back to 1731; it was a century later when steam-powered ferries began running the route. The City took over the ships in 1905, and they&rsquo;ve remained an important part of the New York transit system, as well as a major tourist attraction since then. Before bridges linked NYC&rsquo;s islands (Staten Island, Manhattan and Long Island &ndash; on which Brooklyn and Queens sit), boats were the way people travelled from one to another. Of the ferry services that still exist, the Staten Island Ferry serves by far the greatest number of passengers.</li>\n<li><strong><u>The 9/11 Memorial &amp; Museum:</u></strong> designed by architect Michael Arad in collaboration with landscape architect Peter Walker. Arad, who witnessed the second plane hitting the World Trade Centre&rsquo;s south tower, designed the 9/11 Memorial Museum to tells the story of the events of 9/11 through artefacts that range in scale from the monumental to the intimate, as well as through first-person accounts and multimedia displays. The 9/11 Memorial consists of two enormous reflecting pools set in the footprints of the Twin Towers. Each pool is about an acre in size, 30-foot waterfalls cascade down all sides. Hundreds of white oak trees line the surrounding plaza. Advance purchase of museum admission is strongly recommended. The 9/11 is open daily.</li>\n<li><strong><u>Prospect Park:</u></strong> constructed between 1865 and 1895 by Central Park designers Frederick Law Olmsted and Calvert Vaux, Prospect Park is one of NY&rsquo;s most beautiful and intriguing public spaces. With a size of 585-acre, the park is sandwiched between five Brooklyn neighbourhoods &ndash; Park Slope, Prospect Heights, Prospect Lefferts Gardens, Prospect Park South and Windsor Terrace. Prospect Park is known for its luxuriously vast green spaces, including wetlands, forest areas and a great number of trees. Some of its more popular attractions include the bandshell, Audubon Centre, the zoo and Grand Army Plaza, to name a few.</li>\n<li><strong><u>Coney Island</u>:</strong> Coney Island &ndash; New York City&rsquo;s legendary amusement district &ndash; is not a theme park. The home of the Cyclone roller coaster, the Wonder Wheel, the original Nathan&rsquo;s Famous hot dogs and the Boardwalk is something different: a seaside playground that&rsquo;s also a real-life NYC neighbourhood. Its many attractions have made it a warm-weather favourite for all, featuring see-it-to-believe-it sideshows, beachfront stands selling funnel cake, one of the City&rsquo;s oldest and best pizzerias and the Brooklyn Cyclones baseball team. On a bright summer day, no place feels more electric.</li>\n<li><strong><u>Lincoln Centre for the Performing Arts</u>:</strong> Lincoln Centre is one of the cornerstones of New York City&rsquo;s culture, consisting of a campus of 11 organisations focused on music, dance and theatre. The David H. Koch Theatre, Metropolitan Opera House and David Geffen Hall provide stages for the New York City Ballet, Met Opera and New York Philharmonic &ndash; three of the 11 arts organisation in residence at Lincoln Centre.</li>\n<li><strong><u>The High Line:</u></strong> one of the City&rsquo;s most popular and distinctive parks. Built on a once-abandoned elevated rail line, the green space offers unparalleled views of Manhattan&rsquo;s far west side. With places to sit and people-watch, patches of grass, seasonal blooms and fascinating architectural feature throughout, it&rsquo;s a great place to relax, and makes for an envy-inducing photo backdrop.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>III. Gastronomy</strong></p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>1. The must-taste of city:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><u>Pizza</u> </strong>(signature for its big proportion): Joe&rsquo;s Pizza, NY Pizza Surprema, Williamsburg Pizza, Best Pizza, Totonno&rsquo;s Pizzeria Napolitano</li>\n<li><strong><u>Bagel</u> </strong>(signatory boiled and baked to achieve a shiny finish and chewy consistency): Bagel Hole, Murray&rsquo;s Bagels, Sadelle&rsquo;s</li>\n<li><strong><u>Cheesecake</u></strong> (NY cheesecake is known to be dense and creamy): Junior&rsquo;s, S&amp;S Cheesecake, Eileen&rsquo;s Special Cheesecake</li>\n<li><strong><u>General Tso&rsquo;s Chicken</u></strong> (delicious Chinese chicken dishes): Hunan House (classic), China Gourmet (cheap and cheerful), Shun Lee Palace (modern), Mission Chinese Food (well known for Old Fashioned cocktails)</li>\n<li><strong><u>Egg Cream</u></strong>: Gem Spa, Yonah Schimmel Knish Bakery, Brooklyn Farmacy &amp; Soda Fountain</li>\n<li><strong><u>Pastrami and Corned Beef</u>:</strong> Katz&rsquo;s Delicatessen, Ben&rsquo;s Best, David&rsquo;s Brisket House, 2<sup>nd</sup> Ave Deli</li>\n<li><strong><u>Street Meat</u>:</strong> Famous Halal Guys (chicken-lamb combo), Kwik Meal (lamb), Carnegie John&rsquo;s (grilled chicken), Lil Zeus Lunch Box (pork souvlaki)</li>\n<li><strong><u>Cronut</u></strong> (a flaky doughnut shell layered in the fashion of a croissant, with a creamy filling inside and icing on top): Dominique Ansel Bakery (most famous), Mille-Feuille, Dessert Club, Chikalicious, Paris Baguette</li>\n</ul>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>2. The iconic local restaurants:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Bouley (163 Duane St, New York, NY 10013):</strong> Contemporary French cuisine</li>\n<li><strong>Daniel Boulud (60 E. 65<sup>th</sup> St, New York, NY 10065):</strong> French contemporary cuisine</li>\n<li><strong>Eleven Madison Park (11 Madison Ave., New York, NY 10010):</strong> one of the world&rsquo;s finest dining experience</li>\n<li><strong>Gabriel Kruther (41 W. 42<sup>nd</sup> St, New York, NY 10036):</strong> modern Western cuisine</li>\n<li><strong>Jean-Georges (Trump International Hotel &amp; Tower New York &ndash; 1 Central Park W., New York, NY 10023):</strong> master chef inspired modern Western cuisine.</li>\n<li><strong>Le Bernardin (The AXA Equitable Building &ndash; 155 W. 51<sup>st</sup> St, New York, NY 10019):</strong> specialized in seafood</li>\n<li><strong>Masa (Time Warner Center &ndash; 10 Columbus Cir., New York, NY 10019):</strong> considered best Japanese restaurant in America.</li>\n<li><strong>Nobu New York (105 Hudson St, New York, NY 10013):</strong> Robert de Niro&rsquo;s restaurant chain, famous for the divine Japanese cuisine</li>\n<li><strong>Per Se (Time Warner Center &ndash; 10 Columbus Cir.

Despite its location in one of New York&rsquo;s trendiest Brooklyn neighbourhood, the Luger experience is staunchly old-fashioned (no credit cards) in the best sense of the phrase.</li>\n<li><strong>Bamonte&rsquo;s:</strong> Bamonte&rsquo;s is Brooklyn&rsquo;s oldest family owned and operated Italian restaurant, in business since 1990. They specialised in Nepolitan cooking and offer their customers an ambiance of Old World charm and service. Their specialty dishes include linguine with crab sauce, seafood fra diavolo, pork chop with vinegar peppers, mussels marinara and homemade pasta, as well as other seasonal dishes.</li>\n<li><strong>L&amp;B Spumoni Gardens:</strong> In the land of floppy triangles, the square-shaped pizza is king. L&amp;B Spumoni Gardens is one of those great historic pizzerias peculiar to Brooklyn, but L&amp;B serves a uniquely satisfying Sicilian slice: thick slabs of crust, with a layer of mozzarella below a hefty serving of tomato sauce and olive oil with a sprinkling of Pecorino Romano cheese.</li>\n<li><strong>Iris Caf&eacute;:</strong> It&rsquo;s not always easy to get a seat in this small, bohemian caf&eacute;-it&rsquo;s lovable, so everybody comes here, even from Manhattan-plus, people on laptops understandably don&rsquo;t want to relinquish their perfect, sunny perches. A hipster crew dispenses great breakfast (house-made granola, sticky buns, eggs with cheddar cheese grits), lunch (sandwiches with arresting combinations, sweet and spicy beef jerky) and excellent Stumptown coffee. You can also make a grocery run here for fresh milk, free-range eggs and other assorted staples.</li>\n<li><strong>Butter &amp; Scotch:</strong> a honky-tonk with a difference, specialising in desserts and cocktails. Strains of funk and gospel accompany visits here, and a neon sign declaring &ldquo;Eat Pie&rdquo; hangs over the swinging doors that lead to the kitchen. Partners Keavy Blueher and Allision Kave funded their merry venture through a Kickstarter campaign, allowing them to buy professional baker&rsquo;s ovens and a liquor license. The rollicking corner space is convenient to the Brooklyn Botanic Garden and the Franklin Avenue subway top. At happy hours, certain drinks and desserts are discounted, but it&rsquo;s a happy scene here pretty much all the time. In addition to frosted layer cakes, fresh made caramel corn and mini cupcakes, this sweet spot offers savoury items like pimento cheese with Triscuits, cheesy puffs and salty sesame-chile popcorn.</li>\n<li><strong>Buttermilk Channel:</strong> an American bistro best known for its duck meatloaf and buttermilk fried chicken with cheddar waffles. The seasonal menu has its lighter side as well with whole grilled fish, local oysters and plenty of vegetarian options. Signature and classic cocktails are skilfully prepared and the wine list is focused on small, traditional French and American wineries. The restaurant is named for the tidal straight between Brooklyn and Governors Island, said to be so strong it could churn milk into butter.</li>\n<li><strong>Maison Premier:</strong> this oyster house with a spirited atmosphere, bivalves and absinthe in copious quantities is a one famous restaurant in town. The interior of Maison Premier is nothing short of lovely; a modern homage to Parisian and New Orleans oyster bars of yesteryear. The emphasis here is on old-world elegance, from the grand marble horseshoe bar at the heart of the space to the carefully considered details throughout. There is also a worth-noting menu, which boasts 30 different oyster varieties, top-notch cocktails and the &ldquo;largest premium absinthe collection in New York City&rdquo;. Happy hour, from 4-7pm on weekdays and 11am-1pm on weekends, is particularly busy, thanks to oysters priced at just $1 each.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Queens Dining:</strong>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Casa Enrique:</strong> for its impressive posole, mole and chile relleno, Casa Enrique captured a star in Michelin&rsquo;s 2015 guide. The Long Island City restaurant was singled out for its &ldquo;haute take on Mexican cuisine&rdquo; that&rsquo;s a &ldquo;welcome blend of creativity and tradition. The &ldquo;haute&rdquo; part comes courtesy of Cosme Aguilar, a French-trained chef from Mexico&rsquo;s southernmost state of Chiapas. He and his brother Luis opened this sleed, contemporary hot spot in 2012 and got noticed almost immediately for superior tacos cradling slowly cooked brisket and complex, labor-intensive mole sauce saturating tender chicken breast. Kick things off with some fine tequila and chunky, jalapeno-laced guacamole, and finish with luscious, caramel-topped tres leche cake.</li>\n<li><strong>Danny Brown Wine Bar &amp; Kitchen:</strong> For four years, Forest Hill&rsquo;s Danny Brown Wine Bar &amp; Kitchen was the only Queens restaurant with a Michelin star. In 2015, the standby took home the honour for a fifth straight year, this time joined by three other borough eateries. The intimate, convivial enoteca isappointed with modern art and has a stylish European vibe. Chef and co-owner Danny Brown trained in kitchens in Spain, France and Italy, and there&rsquo;s an element of each nation&rsquo;s cuisine in his own. Balanced, perfectly executed dishes include Serrano ham croquettes, bacon-wrapped terrine of rabbit with red-wine-poached prunes, and mighty sweet pea ravioli with black olive crumble and light ricotta. Wines on the list span the globe.</li>\n<li><strong>Dumpling Galaxy:</strong> Flushing is bursting with great Asian spots, and the one everyone&rsquo;s heading to these days is Dumpling Galaxy. Inside the Arcadia Mall, a few blocks from the last stop on the 7 train in Queens, is a modern, red-accented restaurant featuring a veritable star system of dumplings. Lamb and chives, duck and shiitakes, beed and carrots, asparagus and egg- these only begin the tell the story. Steamed or panfried, they&rsquo;re overstuffed, artful sealed and very tasty. Other specialties over the years include scallion pancakes, steamed whole fish and sweet and sour pork.</li>\n<li><strong>Mapo Korean B.B.Q:</strong> Queen&rsquo;s Murray Hill, whose name comes from the same family as the Murray Hill in Manhattan, hosts a thriving Korean population and feels like a village on the outskirts of Seoul. Mapo Korean B.B.Q is among the neighbourhood&rsquo;s best steakhouses, although it&rsquo;s so unadorned it looks more like a barbecue joint. Prime meats are marinated and cooked over charcoals embedded in the centre of each table, the duty handled by assiduous waitresses who control the flames and flip and snip bites small enough to be wrapped in lettuce leaves. Kalbi-beef shirt ribs-are the most essential dish here, and their price includes a whirlwind of accompaniments like tofu soup, spicy kimchi, marinated vegetables, creamed corn, smashed potatoes, potato salad and steamed, custard-like eggs.</li>\n<li><strong>Salt &amp; Fat:</strong> the tasty of two components liberally applied, in various guises (frequently bacon or ham, sometimes spicy mayo or a duck fat crouton), to the like of grilled asparagus, Prince Edward Island mussels&rsquo; broth, arctic char and the occasional dessert are all served in thie Sunnyside restaurant in Queens. Chef and owner Daniel Yi frequently alters his globally influenced New American menu and keeps portions small, tapas style, so course are rich but not heavy. Three to four dishes are enough for two to share. The comfortable, candlelit space offers attentive service, compliment bacon-fat popcorn to start and free yoghurt drinks at the end.</li>\n<li><strong>Taverna Kyclades:</strong> Astoria has grown more multicultural in recent years but retains a strong Greek contingent. It also continues to attracts multitudes of Greek food lovers, judging from the lines out the door at Taverna Kyclades. Even on weekdays, people wait for sidewalk tables-especially when it&rsquo;s sunny. The boisterous, Mediterranean-themed dining room is appointed with a trophy swordfish, signifying that seafood is a strong point. Charred, meaty octopus, lightly battered calamari and whole sea bass all taste freshly caught. Pan-fried cheese, giant salads and assorted dips of skordalia, tzatziki and taramosalata spread on pita are also wonderful. The staff adds to the good cheer by handing out complimentary wine id the wait is long-and carafes are such a good deal there&rsquo;s no reason to not keep it flowing.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Bronx Dining:</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>South Bronx = Soul Food</li>\n<li>Arthur Avenue = Italian Provisions</li>\n<li>City Island = Fresh Seafood</li>\n<li>The rest of Bronx = Cuisine of the World.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>IV.

25	San Francisco		\N	<h1><strong><strong>SAN FRANCISCO</strong></strong></h1>\n<p><strong>I. General Information</strong></p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>1. Introduction</strong></p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;">San Francisco have taken many visitors&rsquo; hearts with its rich culture and fabled nightlife. While the city may not be the nation&rsquo;s biggest city, it certainly is one of its most cosmopolitan. The iconic Golden Gate Bridge, hilly landscape, year-round fog, cable cars and colourful Victorian houses are all what make San Francisco so wonderfully interesting.</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>2. History of Foundation</strong></p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The earliest evidence of human habitation of the territory of the city of San Francisco dates to 3000BC, that&rsquo;s right, about 10,000 years ago. Even before the Pacific waters had breached the span now covered by the Golden Gate Bridge, the Yelamu group of the Ohlone people resided in a few small villages. The city remained untouched by Europeans until 1579 when Sir Francis Drake, the decorated English lotter of Spanish galleons sailed past the entrance of the San Francisco Bay, dubbed a stretch of Marin &ldquo;Nova Albion&rdquo; and sailed away.</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;">In 1821, Mexico won its independence from Spain, cementing the decline of the mission era. In 1835 an American, William Richardson, became the first permanent resident of Yerba Buena. By the 1840s, dozens more Americans came to Alta California and began agitating for independence. After a briefly declared &ldquo;California Republic&rdquo;, they welcomed the arrival of James B. Montgomery, a U.S Navy captain who came ashore on 9<sup>th</sup> July 1846, to raise the U.S flag in Yerba Buena&rsquo;s plaza (Portsmouth Square today).</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;">On 24<sup>th</sup> January 1848, the first gold was found at Sutter&rsquo;s Fort, in the California foothills. Within months, san Francisco became the central port and depot of the frenzied Gold Rush. Over the next year, arriving &ldquo;forty-niners&rdquo; increased the city&rsquo;s population from 1,000 to 25,000.</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;">On 18<sup>th</sup> April 1906, the San Andreas Fault slipped more than 10 feet, unleashing a massive earthquake later estimated at 7.8 on the Richter scale. The tremors broke water mains and triggered fires that raged for four days, killing 3,000 people, destroying 25,000 buildings and leaving 250,000 homeless. The city rebuilt quickly with an improved city centre and hosted the lavish Panama International Exposition just nine years later. The 1930s saw growth both in the city and its outlying communities, and the construction of the iconic Golden Gate and San Francisco Bay Bridges.</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;">San Francisco was the main point of embarkation for World War II&rsquo;s Pacific theatre, and the region became a major arms production centre. After Pearl Harbor, the city&rsquo;s Japanese residents were forced into internment camps far island. Their abandoned neighbourhood was soon filled by African-Americans arriving from the South to work in the war industries. The city also played a key role in the transition from World War II to the Cold War, hosting the 1954 conference at which the UN Charter was drafted and continuing to draw workers to develop technologies for the nuclear age.</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;">San Francisco has maintained its reputation as a centre of cultural bohemianism. In earlier it had drawn writers from Mark Twain to Jack London, and it became a centre for the 1950s beat poets and for the Haight-Ashbury hippie counterculture that peaked with the 1967 &ldquo;Summer of Love&rdquo;. On 17<sup>th</sup> October 1989, another large earthquake hit the city, damaging buildings, collapsing freeways and killing 67 people. A decade later, a boom cantered on Internet Technology began, drawing entrepreneurs to the city and raising rents, respectability and resentment in its rougher neighbourhoods. The crowded city&rsquo;s population, steady for decades, began to rise again.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>3. Area &amp; population</strong></p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;">San Francisco is located on the West Coast of the United States at the north end of the San Francisco Peninsula and includes significant stretches of the Pacific Ocean and San Francisco Bay within its boundaries. Several picturesque islands &ndash; Alcatraz, Treasure Island and the adjacent Yerba Buena Island, and small portions of Alameda Island, Red Rock Island, and Angel Island &ndash; are part of the city.</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The neighbourhood of San Francisco are as diverse as they are fascinating. Whether moving to the Golden Gate City or just trying to get to know its most unique area, below are the neighbourhood guide to the basics of each neighbourhood, outlining the main attractions and some of the more notable hotspot unique to each.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Castro District:</strong> the area historically known as Eureka Valley where working-class Scandinavian and Irish used to reside. Now the universally agreed Mecca of gay life is San Francisco&rsquo;s Castro District. The affluent North side of Market is home to a predominantly gay and lesbian community, excellent bakeries, boutiques, cafes, restaurants, and of course, gender bending bars. The famed Castro Theatre, the Castro&rsquo;s historic art deco movie palace, screen old and independent films from around the world. On Halloween, the centre of San Francisco is the Castro, with crowds in the thousands celebrating on the streets.</li>\n<li><strong>The South Market:</strong> was once San Francisco&rsquo;s industrial core, has been through significant development and is home to new skyscrapers, live-work lofts, and condominiums.</li>\n<li><strong>Fisherman&rsquo;s Wharf:</strong> popular with tourists and sea lions, the area is full of shops, silly museums and family fun. Still a working wharf, its vendors sell thousands of tons of fish and shellfish. Take an early morning to walk down &ldquo;Fish Alley&rdquo; to see fisherman at work. Later, the Wharf is boardwalk-style family entertainment with decidedly attractions such as Ripley&rsquo;s Believe It or Not! Museum, the Red &amp; White Fleet, the Wax Museum, and the Aquarium. For maritime-lovers and WWII buffs, the San Francisco Maritime Museum is at the foot of Polk St and massive USS Pampanito is docked right at pier 45.</li>\n<li><strong>Financial District:</strong> named for its abundance of modern and historic buildings that house headquarters of corporations like Charles Schwab, Gap Inc., VISA, the 12<sup>th</sup> district of the Federal Reserve and more. Shopping malls like Embarcadero Center, the Ferry Building and Crocker Galleria frequently welcome spree-loving locals and leisure travellers. By virtue of all the businesses in the area, there are also plenty of snazzy little bars where many of the corporate bigwigs have been known to enjoy a martini lunch.</li>\n<li><strong>Mission District:</strong> reputation for hipsters, Latinos, cheap food and drink. The heart of San Francisco&rsquo;s predominantly Latino neighbourhood is 24<sup>th</sup> Street, a colourful collection of authentic restaurants, tanquerias, Mexican bakeries, produce markets, specialty shops and murals. Mission Dolores at 16<sup>th</sup> and Dolores street is the oldest structure in San Francisco (many of San Fran&rsquo;s Spanish pioneers are buried on the site) and, two blocks away, on Dolores and 18<sup>th</sup>, the palm tree studded Dolores Park (O&rsquo;Dolores Beach to sunbathers) still has a Spanish flavour.</li>\n<li><strong>North Beach:</strong> San Francisco&rsquo;s version of the Red Light District, North Beach at night is a bustling neon home to strip joints, bars, cafes and restaurants. Meander through the streets off Broadway and see how it&rsquo;s called San Francisco&rsquo;s &ldquo;Little Italy&rdquo;. Like its Italian heritage, this San Fran neighbourhood still holds onto its 1950s Beatnik legacy with the bohemian City Lights Bookstore at the corner of Columbus Ave and Jack Kerouac Alley. Don&rsquo;t miss Tai Chi nearby Washington Square on weekdays or the North Beach Jazz Festival every August.</li>\n<li><strong>Chinatown:</strong> reputation for exotic, crowded open markets and being the oldest neighbourhood in San Francisco. Enter at &ldquo;Dragon&rsquo;s Gate&rdquo; at Grant Ave and Bush Street. This neighbourhood is packed with Chinese restaurants, shops, temples and street vendors; great for exotic gifts, and fireworks on Lunar New Year.</li>\n<li><strong>SOMA:</strong> San Francisco&rsquo;s sprawling South of Market District (SOMA) is home to web gurus, urban warriors, offbeat artists, and an unending supply of club kids. This neighbourhood&rsquo;s industrial, warehouse nature is perfect for the mega clubs and leatherman alike. Dance-hungry hipsters flock to bars like 1015 Folsom and the infamous End Up while risqu&eacute; gay bars like the Eagle, the Stud and the Hole In the Wall draw a more community more diverse than then queens of the Castro. In the daylight hours, look for substantial San Francisco discount shopping, like cheap fabrics, designer labels and furniture.</li>\n<li><strong>Union Square:</strong> A lone Corinthian column surrounded by newly installed palm tree marks San Fran&rsquo;s mecca for shopaholics. Ringed by Macy&rsquo;s, Saks, Neiman Marcus and Levi&rsquo;s stores along with colourful flower stands and street performers. Surrounding street feature superstores like Virgin Megastore, FAO Schwarz, Gump&rsquo;s and Britex Fabrics along with boutiques for Coach, Bulgari, Cartier, Thomas Pink, Louis Vuitton, MaxMara, Emporio Armani, Diesel, Prada, Celine, Escada, Gucci, Guess, Hermes, Agnes B., Bestsey Johnson and Wilkes Bashford.</li>\n</ul>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The U.S Census 2015 reported that San Francisco had a population of 805,235. With a population density of 12,160 per square mile, San Francisco is the second-most densely populated major American city behind only New York. The city&rsquo;s demographic is 48.5% non-Hispanic white, 33.3% Asian, Hispanic and Latino makes up 15% of the population, 6% Black or African American, and the below 1% rest is of other races (American Indian, Native Hawaiian Pacific Islander).</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>4.

The January 1967 Human Be-In at Golden Gate Park kicked it off.</li>\n<li>Speaking of seasonal confusion, Mark Twain wasn&rsquo;t as down on San Fran&rsquo;s weather as some people would have you believe. Twain never uttered the quote &ldquo;The coldest winter I ever spent was a summer in San Francisco&rdquo;.</li>\n<li>The neighbourhoods of Marina, Mission Bay, and Hunters Point are all built atop of a landfill.</li>\n<li>The first bubonic plague epidemic in the continental US broke out in SF&rsquo;s Chinatown in 1900.</li>\n<li>As historical beginnings go, the United Nations Charter was drafted and ratified in San Francisco in 1945.</li>\n<li>The Beatles gave their last full concert at Candlestick Park in 29<sup>th</sup> August, 1966.</li>\n<li>Contemporary reports of the fire note that an unlikely hero helped save the city: Redwood trees. When fire hit buildings made of redwood, which has low resin content and a porous grain that takes in lots of water, they didn&rsquo;t go up in smoke.</li>\n<li>In September 1859, San Francisco&rsquo;s favourite eccentric resident, Joshua Abraham Norton, declared himself America&rsquo;s emperor.</li>\n<li>Emperor Norton had a following: nearly 30,000 people later packed the streets for his funeral.</li>\n<li>The bear on California&rsquo;s state flag is modelled after a California grizzly named Monarch, who was held at Golden Gate Park.</li>\n<li>The U.S Navy originally planned on painting the Golden Gate Bridge black with yellow stripes.

After the exposition ended, it returned to Philadelphia, where it&rsquo;s stayed ever since.</li>\n</ul>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>5. Weather</strong></p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;">San Francisco&rsquo;s climate is characteristic of the cool-summer Mediterranean climate of California&rsquo;s coast, with moist wild winter and dry summers. San Francisco&rsquo;s weather is strongly influenced by the cool currents of the Pacific Ocean on the west side of the city, and the water of San Francisco Bay to the north and east. Among U.S cities, San Fran has the coolest daily mean, maximum, and minimum temperature for June, July and August. During the Summer, rising hot air in California&rsquo;s interior valleys creates a low pressure area that draws winds from the North Pacific High through the Golden Gate, which creates the city&rsquo;s characteristic cools winds and fog. The fog is less pronounced in eastern neighbourhoods and during the late summer and early fall, which is the warmest time of the year.</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The dry period of May to October is mild to warm, with the normal monthly mean temperature peaking in September at 62.7 &deg;F (17.1 &deg;C). The rainy period of November to April is slightly cooler, with the normal monthly mean temperature reaching its lowest in January at 51.3 &deg;F (10.7 &deg;C). Snowfall in the city is very rare, with only 10 measurable accumulations recorded since 1852, most recently in 1976 when up to 5 inches (13cm) fell on Twin Peaks.</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>6. Transportation</strong></p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Due to its unique geography, and the freeway revolts of the late 1950s, San Francisco is one of the few American cities with arterial thoroughfares instead of having numerous highways within the city.</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Interstate 80 begins at the approach to the Bay Bridge and is the only direct automobile link to the East Bay U.S Route 101 connects to the western terminus of Interstate 80 and provides access to the south of the city along San Francisco Bay toward Silicon Valley. Northward, the routing for U.S 101 uses arterial streets to connect to the Golden Gate Bridge, the only direct automobile link to Marin County and the North Bay.</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;">State Route 1 also enters San Francisco from the north via the Golden Gate Bridge and bisects the city as the 19<sup>th</sup> Avenue arterial thoroughfare, joining with the Interstate 280 at the city&rsquo;s southern border.</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;">State Route 35 enters the city from the south as Skyline Boulevard and terminates at its intersection with Highway 1. State Route 82 enters San Francisco from the south as Mission Street, and terminates shortly thereafter at its junction with 280.</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;">32% of San Francisco residents use public transportation in daily commuting to work ranking it first on the West Coast and third overall in the United States.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>The San Francisco Municipal Railway (known as Muni)</strong> is the primary public transit system of San Francisco. Muni is the seventh-largest transit system in the United States. The system operates both a combined light rail and subway system, the Muni Metro, and a large bus network. Additionally, it runs a historic streetcar line, which designated as a National Historic Landmark to Fisherman&rsquo;s Wharf. It also operates the famous cable cars, which have been designated as a National Historic Landmark and are a major tourist attraction.<br /><img src="/images/h.png" width="588" height="523" /></li>\n<li><strong>BART:</strong> a regional Rapid Transit system, connects San Francisco with the East Bay through the underwater Transbay Tube. The line runs under Market Street to Civic Center where it turns south to the Mission District, the southern part of the city, and through northern San Mateo County, to the San Francisco International Airport, and Millbrae. Another Commuter Rail system, Caltrain, runs from San Francisco along the San Francisco Peninsula to San Jose. Historically, trains operated by Southern Pacific Lines ran from San Francisco to Los Angeles, via Palo Alto and San Jose.<br /><img src="/images/i.png" /></li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>AMTRAK California Thruway Motorcoach</strong> runs a shuttle bus from San Francisco to its rail station across the Bay in Emeryville. Lines from Emeryville include the Capitol Corridor, San Joaquin, California Zephyr, and Coast Starlight. Thruway service also runs south to San Luis Obispo, California with connection to the Pacific Surfiner.<br /><img src="/images/j.jpg" /></li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>San Francisco Bay Ferry</strong> operates from the Ferry Building and Pier 39 to points in Oakland, Alameda, Bay Farm Island, South San Francisco, and north to Vallejo in Solano County. The Golden Gate Ferry is the other ferry operator with service between San Francisco and Marin County. Soltrans runs supplement bus service between the Ferry Building and Vallejo.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>II. Attractions</strong></p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>1. PIER 39:</strong> located in San Francisco&rsquo;s Fisherman&rsquo;s Wharf, at Beach Street and The Embarcadero.

Golden Gate Bridge</strong></p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Once called &ldquo;the bridge that couldn&rsquo;t be built&rdquo;, today it is one of the seven wonders of the modern world. This magnificent span, perhaps San Francisco&rsquo;s most famous landmark, opened in 1937 after a four-year struggle against relentless winds, fog, rock and treacherous tides. The bridge was built at a cost of $35 million in principal and $39 million in interest and 11 worker&rsquo;s lives. The single-suspension span is anchored by twin towers that reach skyward 746 feet, and was once taller than any building in San Francisco. To support the suspended roadway, two cables, each more than 7,000 feet in length and both containing 80,000 miles of wire stretch over the top of the towers and are rooted in concrete anchorages on shore. More than 10 years in planning due to formidable opposition, but only four years in actual construction, the Golden Gate Bridge brought the communities of San Francisco and Marin counties closer together. Some fun facts about the Golden Gate Bridge:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The Golden Gate Bridge has lost 7,500 tons (in weight) since it opened in 1937</li>\n<li>It is estimated that 5,000 &ndash; 10,000 gallons of paint are used to repaint the Golden Gate Bridge each year.</li>\n<li>Three babies have been born on the Golden Gate Bridge. All of them have been boys.</li>\n<li>The name came from the fact that the Golden Gate Strait (named by John Fremont) is the entrance into San Francisco Bay form the Pacific Ocean.</li>\n<li>International Orange was selected as the colour of the bridge because it provided visibility in the fog for passing ships and also because it was a colour that fit in naturally to the bridge&rsquo;s setting and the surrounding land area.</li>\n<li>The bridge has only been closed three times due to weather since it was built; all three due to high winds gusting close to or over 70 miles per hour.</li>\n</ul>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>3. Golden Gate Park:</strong> One of the largest urban parks in the world, Golden Gate Park stretches for three miles on the western edge of San Francisco. There&rsquo;s not a single &ldquo;Keep Off the Grass&rdquo; sign and its 1,017 acres are a tonic for mind and body. Two major museums, splendid gardens and facilities for more than 20 sports confirm that this is a playground in every sense of the world.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>The de Young Museum</strong>: a top destination while visiting San Francisco, the de Young museum showcases an extraordinary permanent collection of American art from the 17<sup>th</sup> through 21<sup>st</sup> centuries, modern and contemporary art, photography, international textiles and costumes, and art from Africa, Oceania, and the Americas. The ninth-floor Observation Level of the de Young&rsquo;s Hamon Tower offers breathtaking 360-degree views of San Francisco and the Pacific Ocean. It closes most Monday and holidays, special exhibition tickets available for additional price.</li>\n<li><strong>California Academy of Sciences</strong>: explore an aquarium, planetarium and natural history museum all under one living roof.

This gem of Victorian architecture has a long and storied history, and is the oldest public wood-and-glass conservatory in North America. Since re-opening in 2003, the Conservatory has garnered numerous local, state and national awards; as well as a place where horticultural societies, botany students, and young plant enthusiasts gather to study collections and ensure passions for living museums and conservatories will continue to flourish.</li>\n</ul>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>4. Lombard Street:</strong> known as the &ldquo;Crookedest Street in the World&rdquo;, Lombard Street is one of San Francisco&rsquo;s most popular landmark. Every year, hundreds of thousands of visitors walk or drive down its eight sharp hairpin turns. Surrounded by Russian Hill mansions and perfectly manicured landscaping and flowers, it is also one of the city&rsquo;s most scenic streets. Take a spectacular photo at the bottom of the curvy portion looking up or enjoy the breathtaking view from the top looking out onto the San Francisco Bay, the Bay Bridge and Coit Tower. Some fun facts:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Although it is known as the &ldquo;Crookedest Street in the World&rdquo;, Lombard Street is not even the &ldquo;crookedest&rdquo; street in San Francisco. That title technically belongs to Vermont Street between 20<sup>th</sup> and 22<sup>nd</sup> streets on Potrero Hill.</li>\n<li>It may look treacherous but Lombard Street&rsquo;s switchbacks were actually built to increase the safety of the street. The natural steep grade of Potrero Hill was thought to be too dangerous. In the 1920s, a property owner suggested a series of switchboards which not only add to the street&rsquo;s scenic appeal but made it safer for pedestrians.</li>\n<li>The name Lombard actually has no link to San Francisco history. It is named after a street in Philadelphia.</li>\n<li>A race every Easter Sunday where people race big-wheeled plastic bikes, started on Lombard Street before moving to Vermont Street on Potrero Hill, where it takes place now.</li>\n</ul>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>5. Alcatraz Island</strong>: Alcatraz was the site of the first lighthouse in the Western United States but became a federal penitentiary from 1934-1963, housing famous convicts such as Al Capone and George &ldquo;Machine Gun&rdquo; Kelly. Now this once infamous prison island is part of the Bay Area&rsquo;s 80,000-acre Golden Gate National Recreation Area. Located one-and-a-half miles from Fisherman&rsquo;s Wharf, Alcatraz is one of the city&rsquo;s most popular attractions. A visit to the island includes a tour of the cell house where visitors can see where the prisoners lived. Although the last inmates were transferred off the island in 1963, the main prison block with its steel bars, claustrophobic (9 x 5-foot) cells, messy hall, library and &ldquo;dark holes&rdquo;, where recalcitrant languished in inky blackness, is still structurally intact.</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>6. SFMOMA:</strong> Founded in 1935 as the first West Coast museum devoted to modern and contemporary art, a thoroughly transformed San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, with enhanced gallery, education, and public spaces, opened on May 14, 2016.

Stop for lunch at Caf&eacute; 5 if you feel hungry, choose the table in the rooftop sculpture garden.</li>\n<li><strong>Fourth Floor:</strong> Find your way to the glorious Ellsworth Kelly galleries. They span all stages of the artist&rsquo;s career, like a mini survey, and are guaranteed to lift your spirits. Then bliss out in the secluded, octagonal-shaped &ldquo;chapel&rdquo; of seven paintings by Agnes Martin.</li>\n<li><strong>Third Floor:</strong> This level is largely devoted to <a href="http://www.sftravel.com/article/5-picture-perfect-destinations-photography-lover">photography</a>, one of SFMOMA&rsquo;s great points of distinction. But on a tight schedule you may have to save that for another time. Instead check out the delightful Alexander Calder &ldquo;motion lab&rdquo; (on view through Sept. 17, 2017) and experience a concentration of the artist&rsquo;s mobiles that extends into an outdoor terrace framed by a gigantic vertical garden. Indoor-outdoor visitor circulation creates airflow into these galleries, which allows the sculptures to do their thing.&nbsp;Then get your afternoon caffeine fix at the new Sightglass coffee bar.&nbsp;</li>\n<li><strong>Second Floor:</strong> You must at least whiz through SFMOMA&rsquo;s re-envisioned permanent collection galleries, stopping to say hello to greatest hits like Matisse&rsquo;s <em>Femme au Chapeau</em> and Mark Rothko&rsquo;s luminous <em> 14, 1960, </em>among other old friends like Frida Kahlo&rsquo;s self-portrait with hubby Diego Rivera and important works by Robert Rauschenberg (another great strength of the collection). Grab a souvenir from the new Museum Store outpost in the ticketing court where you started.</li>\n<li><strong>Ground Floor:</strong> Grab a souvenir from the new Museum Store outpost in the ticketing court where you started, then (literally) wind your way through Richard Serra&rsquo;s behemoth walk-in sculpture <em>Sequence</em> and out the door of SFMOMA&rsquo;s new glass-walled gallery facing Howard Street.</li>\n</ul>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>7.

Forbes Island (PIER 39):</strong> this restaurant is on an island (a manmade one, but still, it&rsquo;s an <a href="http://www.sanfrancisco.travel/article/islands-san-francisco-bay">island in San Francisco Bay</a>). You&rsquo;ll even be picked up on a little boat for a quick jaunt to the island (say hello to the <a href="http://www.sanfrancisco.travel/article/sounds-san-francisco-podcast-pier-39-sea-lions">sea lions</a>) and be sure to climb the lighthouse for a great view.

Famous Local Restaurants: </strong></p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>a. For Business Dinner: </strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><u>Boulevard (1 Mission St.):</u></strong> Iconic, landmark and institution are just a few of the words that can be used to describe the 2012 James Beard Award Winner for Outstanding Restaurant, Boulevard. Chef-partner Nancy Oakes and partner Pat Kuleto opened the eatery in 1993 and at the time, the market-driven high-end American cuisine was revolutionary. Today, Boulevard is a quality old guard restaurant that serves up delicious and reliable classics in an unpretentious, but refined setting. The large restaurant, which is located on the Embarcadero and has gorgeous views of the bay, seats 150, plus 26 at the bar.

Kokkari is one of those warm, welcoming, bustling restaurants where regulars encourage newcomers to try the traditional whole grilled fish with lemon, waiters pour heavy glasses of Assyrtiko, a minerally white Greek wine varietal, and everyone&mdash;from the staff to the diners have a grand old time. Unlike some newer restaurants that have a highly edited menu, Kokkari&rsquo;s offerings are extensive and mouthwatering. Some personal favorites include the gigantic baked beans with tomato sauce, olive oil and feta; the grilled calamari stuffed with feta, fennel, orange and black olives, and the authentic moussaka, a traditional Greek casserole with spiced lamb, eggplant, potato and yogurt b&eacute;chamel.</li>\n<li><strong><u>Perbacco (230 California St.):</u></strong> If you&rsquo;re a lover of Italian food and want your successful transaction with a side of housemade tagliatelle and five-hour pork sugo, you can&rsquo;t beat Perbacco. The bi-level restaurant is in the heart of the Financial District along the cable car route that runs up and down California Street. Everything about Perbacco is precise, curated, and detail-oriented, from the chive garnish placed just-so on the broccoli puree to the comprehensive wine list dotted with exceptional French, American and Italian bottles. There is an excellent charcuterie program with a selection of house cured salumi, all of the pastas are handmade in house, and the dessert options are plentiful, in both sweet and savory preparations</li>\n<li><strong><u>Pabu (101 California St):</u></strong> a high-end sushi eatery. When you&rsquo;re looking for the freshest seafood and the most interesting bottles of Japanese whisky, there&rsquo;s only one place to find it, Pabu. Michael Mina and chef Ken Tominaga&rsquo;s buzzy, sleek and happening restaurant is a stunning modern izakaya on California Street near the cable car turnaround. There are several private rooms and booths, as well as a chef&rsquo;s counter where diners can watch the sushi chefs filet fresh toro and season it ever so slightly with smoke or salt to make the most delectable bites of sashimi around. There is also finger-licking good robata skewers of chicken tail or pork belly, soothing miso soup with silken tofu, and American wagyu beef shabu shabu. On weekend nights the crowds can be a little loud, so if you&rsquo;re hosting an event on the company dime on Friday or Saturday, it might be worth booking a private room.</li>\n<li><strong><u>Q (1085 Mission St):</u></strong> A.Q is elegant with wood tables topped with seasonal d&eacute;cor. In fact, everything about A.Q. is a celebration of the current season: the decor, the cocktails, the food and even the website are inspired by spring, summer, autumn or winter. It makes A.Q. a fun restaurant to visit throughout the year, as each time you go, the menu, look and feel is completely different. There are two options to enjoying the upscale California cuisine: a four-course prix fixe menu or a chef&rsquo;s tasting menu. Either are scrumptious choices and do splurge on the innovative beverage pairing&mdash;it's definitely worth it!</li>\n</ul>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>b. Historic Landmark Restaurants: </strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><u>Tadich Grill (240 California St.):</u></strong> Mad Men-style martinis are in demand at the old-school dining room, the nation's first mesquite grill. "We serve 300 martinis a day, a testimonial to our long-standing traditions," says manager David Hanna.

Servers are pros, sporting traditional white jacket and tie to serve up tasty sourdough bread, signature cioppino and a very decent Bloody Mary.</li>\n<li><strong><u>Sam&rsquo;s Grill &amp; Seafood Restaurant (374 Bush St.):</u></strong> The story of Sam's begins with an affable Irishman named Mike who sold the bay&rsquo;s abundant fresh oysters from a waterfront stall in 1867. That enterprise evolved into an oyster saloon. During Prohibition in the 1920s, an owner named Sam stepped into the picture. He experimented with a re-branding using his and his partner's surnames. Zembolich &amp; Zenovich was short-lived (surprised?), so Sam&rsquo;s Grill stuck. Sam&rsquo;s Grill has hosted&nbsp;special moments and whispered secrets for 150 years. Much-loved for a classic Old Fashioned and the freshest daily market fish, Sam&rsquo;s owners have preserved the timeless look and feel of the place. You can even draw the curtains at your private, cosy dining booth where a bell will summon your waiter.&nbsp;</li>\n<li><strong><u>Cliff House (1090 Point Lobos Ave.):</u> </strong>Once host to presidents and wealthy Victorian society, the oceanfront destination alternatively went through periods of popularity among high life and riff-raff. It was adjacent to the immensely popular turn-of-the-20th-century Sutro Baths, then shuttered during Prohibition. Later, it was the centerpiece of a fabled 10-acre amusement park attracting thousands weekly. Although this&nbsp;place with an 1863 birth certificate survived earthquakes, it suffered destruction by fire twice, including an 1887 explosion aboard an offshore schooner wreck. Cliff House started all over again each time in the same Lands&rsquo; End spot. the Cliff House has a live webcam and a website noting the time of sunset, so guests can perfectly time a visit. Settle in with a Ramos Fizz at the Zinc Bar, with its hand-carved back bar salvaged from the 1889 Paris Expo, and stay for Friday night jazz. Take a window table to enjoy house specialties of clam chowder, Crab Louis and the housemade popovers.</li>\n</ul>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>c.

The layout of the nightclub, placement of the speakers, design of the 7 layered dance floor, and the Funktion One sound system were carefully crafted to create a revolutionary auditory experience.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Civic Center/ Hayes Valley for Performance and a Nightcap</strong>:\n<ul>\n<li><strong><u>Davies Symphony Hall:</u></strong> hear the San Francisco Symphony, as well as guest orchestras and a classic film series accompanied by music.</li>\n<li><strong>San Francisco Opera:</strong> located in the historic War Memorial Opera House, the place has been thrilling audiences since 1923. They are known for commissioning numerous world premieres, training some of opera&rsquo;s greatest young artists and being one of the world&rsquo;s leading opera companies.</li>\n<li><strong><u>SFJAZZ Center</u>:</strong> is a music venue in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hayes_Valley">Hayes Valley</a> neighbourhood of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco,_California">San Francisco, California</a>, that opened in January 2013. It is considered the "first free-standing building in America built for jazz performance and education. The building was designed by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Cavagnero_Associates">Mark Cavagnero Associates</a>, and cost $64 million to complete. The performance space is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Miner">Robert N.

It is home to SFJAZZ, a jazz music organization established in 1983. SFJAZZ has, since 1983, produced the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_Jazz_Festival">San Francisco Jazz Festival</a>, and since 2004, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SFJAZZ_Collective">SFJAZZ Collective</a>.</li>\n<li><strong><u>San Francisco Ballet</u>:</strong> San Francisco Ballet, the oldest professional ballet company in America, has emerged as a world-class arts organization since it was founded as the San Francisco Opera Ballet in 1933. Initially, its purpose was to train dancers to appear in opera productions, but it separated from the opera in 1942 and was renamed SF Ballet. Headed by brothers <a href="https://www.sfballet.org/planyourvisit/learn/christensen_brothers#harold">Willam</a>, <a href="https://www.sfballet.org/planyourvisit/learn/christensen_brothers#lew">Lew</a>, and <a href="https://www.sfballet.org/planyourvisit/learn/christensen_brothers#harold">Harold</a> Christensen from the late &rsquo;30s until the &rsquo;70s, it made its mark early on by staging the first full-length American productions of <em>Swan Lake</em> (1940) and <em>Nutcracker </em>(1944)<em>. </em>Under Lew&rsquo;s direction, the Company made its East Coast debut at Jacob&rsquo;s Pillow Dance Festival in 1956 and toured 11 Asian nations the following year, marking the first performances of an American ballet company in the Far East. In October 2013, the Company performed at New York&rsquo;s David H. Koch Theater at Lincoln Center, where <em>The New York Times</em> declared SF Ballet &ldquo;a national treasure.&rdquo; 2015 marks the 30<sup>th</sup> anniversary of Helgi Tomasson&rsquo;s tenure as artistic director of SF Ballet.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>2. Must-try San Francisco Invented Cocktails:</strong></p>\n<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><strong>a. Cable Car:</strong> created in 1996 by Tony Abou-Ganim at the <a href="http://www.sftravel.com/explore/hotels/sir-francis-drake-hotel">Sir Francis Drake&rsquo;s</a> <a href="http://www.sftravel.com/explore/nightlife/starlight-room">Starlight Room</a>. It&rsquo;s an intriguing little twist on the classic sidecar that swaps the original&rsquo;s cognac for Captain Morgan&rsquo;s spiced rum, but keeps the orange liqueur and lemon juice. It also adds a cinnamon sugar rim as a garnish, adding to the spice profile of the cocktail.</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><strong>b. California Milk Punch:</strong> invented by the famous Jerry Thomas during his stint in San Francisco, and uses ingredients as eclectic as the city itself, including lemon, pineapple, green tea, brandy, Jamaican rum, cloves, coriander, cinnamon, and of course milk. The idea behind this milk punch is to curdle the milk and then strain the solids, leaving behind all the nasty particulates, and resulting in a creamy, preservable drink ready for bottling.</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><strong>c. Pisco Punch:</strong> Pisco (which is distilled from Peruvian grape varietals) made its way up to the city from Peru via traders in the 1830s. When the Bank Exchange &amp; Billiard Saloon opened in 1853, it was only natural that they would offer a variety of punches, and the availability of pisco made it a perfect candidate. Duncan Nicol is credited with the original recipe, with pisco, pineapple, lime juice, gum arabic, and water, which was described at the time as &ldquo;like lemonade but comes back with the kick of a roped steer.&rdquo;</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><strong>d. Martini:</strong> After a rough decade being transmogrified into a plethora of sickly sweet &lsquo;tinis, the &ldquo;only American invention as perfect as a sonnet&rdquo; is finally experiencing a glorious comeback. First things first: a martini is made with gin, not vodka. It traces its roots to the classic Martinez (which allegedly was invented just up the bay in the city of the same name) which called for gin, vermouth, and maraschino liqueur. Sometime in the 1860s, the Occidental Hotel in San Francisco dropped the liqueur from the recipe, and the martini was born.</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>3. Winery: </strong></p>\n<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><strong>a. Bluxome Street Winery (53 Bluxome St.):</strong> you&rsquo;ll get a taste of wine and San Francisco history. A reel of old video footage shows San Francisco around the turn of the century (19th to 20th) and those behind the bar can tell you a few things about the area formerly known as &ldquo;South of the Slot&rdquo; before it became &ldquo;SOMA.&rdquo; Mostly though, there&rsquo;s a slough of Russian River wines with Pinot Noir being the focus.</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><strong>b. Chateau Montelena (335 Powell St.):</strong> Chateau Montelena itself is a California landmark and if you can make it up to the winery that is preferable but if not, just step into the Westin St. Francis on Union Square and check out the tasting room in the lobby. The standards are always open and usually there is also a special wine or two being poured.</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><strong>c. Jax Vineyards and Tasting Room (326 Brannan St.):</strong> The first Jax wine was made in a San Francisco garage so it makes complete sense that this family owned and run winery would choose to set up shop within the city&rsquo;s borders. They started out working with the Bordeaux varieties from their home vineyard in Calistoga but have since branched out to make other wines sourcing fruit from other parts of Napa and Sonoma.</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><strong>d. Wattle Creek Winery (900 North Point St.):</strong> Located in the Alexander Valley an hour and a half north of San Francisco, without traffic, Wattle Creek serves up a selection of wines from their estate vineyard. There is a good variety of wines to choose from so no matter what your taste, or how many in your party, everyone should discover something that fits their palate.</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><strong>e. Winery Collective (495 Jefferson St.):</strong> Over a dozen wineries are represented at this outpost in Fisherman&rsquo;s Wharf with a narrower range poured by the glass. Three flights are offered starting with the introductory Locals Flight to the more complex &ldquo;Urban Flight.&rdquo; There are also ten wines poured by the glass selected from the members of the collective.</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>4. Bars at SOMA:</strong></p>\n<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><strong>a. Alchemist Bar &amp; lounge (679 3<sup>rd</sup>):</strong> Alchemist is tucked away on the second floor of a building around the corner from the ballpark. This makes it feel a little bit like a speakeasy and the Steampunk d&eacute;cor promotes that. The space has a loft-like feel, which will make you feel even more as if you stumbled into someone&rsquo;s private party. Swanky as the Alchemist might be, this place is very serious about its cocktails. Ingredients are sourced from Chinese herbalists and artisan purveyors.</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><strong>b. Dirty Water (1355 Market St.):</strong> on the ground floor of the Twitter building, across from The Market, San Francisco&rsquo;s latest gourmet epicenter. The space is open and industrial and it looks great during the day or when the sun goes down. And this is perfect as there are so many delicious drinks offered that you might want to make your choice based on the time of day: vodka in the afternoon, whiskey at night. Or not. Although it is still very new to San Francisco, Dirty Water has nailed its cocktail program and also has an extensive cheese selection and small plates, so be prepared for a long hang out, possibly from day into night.</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><strong>c. Monarch (101 6<sup>th</sup>):</strong> Upstairs, Monarch is a bar and one of the most stylish you&rsquo;ll find in SOMA with plenty of throwback pieces from different eras that seamlessly match. There are a few little nooks for chats with friends but the place has a lively vibe. And, if lively is what you want, check out the downstairs club featuring popular DJ&rsquo;s most nights. Not least, the drinks are killer with several original cocktails such as the Monkey Wrench, a tequila based cocktail that goes down way too easily. However, you can order a Jack and Coke without getting any &ldquo;holier than thou&rdquo; attitude from the bartenders. It&rsquo;s the real deal and there are &ldquo;Amazing Hour&rdquo; drink specials 5:30&ndash;7:30, with various forms of entertainment and festivities.</p>\n<p>Reference:</p>\n<p><a href="http://www.sftravel.com">http://www.sftravel.com</a></p>\n<p><a href="http://www.sanfrancisco.com">http://www.sanfrancisco.com</a></p>	\N	\N	\N	on	1	2017-01-11 00:23:24.548106+00	2017-01-11 00:23:24.548106+00	26	0
24	Orlando		\N	<h1><strong>ORLANDO</strong></h1>\n<p><strong>I. General Information</strong></p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>1. Introduction</strong></p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;">This central Florida city has everything to offer those who are looking to experience the most remarkable moments of their lives including great shopping malls, amazing rides at Disneyland, great food and white-knuckle skydiving encounters. The city boasts over 5,000 restaurants from fine dining experiences to family-friendly favourites, about 170 spectacular golf courses where both novice and expert golfers can take on a wide range of challenging courses, and great shopping centres where you can buy an array of top quality items including jewellery, bags, clothes and much more. The city also plays home to incredible resort style spas where guests are treated to heavenly relaxation. Orlando is most definitely among the world&rsquo;s premier destinations with an array of fun and exciting things to do that keeps most visitors coming back to experience more fun.</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>2. History of Foundation</strong></p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Prior to the arrival of the first European settlers in 1837, the area that is now Orlando was occupied by the Seminole tribe of Native Americans. Historians believe that the Seminoles, whose named is said to mean "wild and separate," inhabited the Central Florida region for 6,000 to 12,000 years. The Second Seminole War, which spanned the period from 1835 to 1842, began when disagreements arose between the natives and the American settlers on such issues as land, cattle, and slaves. In the years following the war the natives moved away, leaving the pioneers who built their town around Fort Gatlin. Until 1845 Orange County, of which the city of Orlando is the county seat, was known as Mosquito County. Tradition holds that Orlando was named after Orlando Reeves, an American soldier on sentinel duty for a scouting party. While Reeves' companion slept, a native approached disguised as a rolling log. Reeves, seeing what was occurring, fired his gun, woke the other soldiers, and saved them from peril. However, Reeves himself succumbed to an arrow shot by the native. Prior to receiving the name Orlando in 1857, the town was known as Jernigan, after Aaron Jernigan, a settler from Georgia.</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;">During the 1880s, some of the pioneers started growing citrus trees. The growth of Orlando in size and prosperity was associated with the need for better transportation to citrus markets on the part of citrus growers. The city had its first rail lines by 1881. During the 1880s and 1890s, there was an influx of new fruit growers. In 1885, Rollins College was founded in Winter Park. By 1886, the city&rsquo;s streets were lined with office buildings, churches, hotels, and schools, and tourists from the north began to spend summers in the area.</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Disaster struck in 1894 when a three-day freeze destroyed nearly all the citrus trees in Orange County. The freeze had a devastating effect on the community, which suffered losses of an estimated $100 million. Packing plants closed, bank closed, people lost their job, and it was 15 years before Orlando fully recovered.</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Between 1910 and 1920 the population of Orlando doubled, and the city was transformed from a rural citrus growing area to a major city. During the 1920s a great building boom aided in Orlando's continuing prosperity, evidenced by the opening of the Orlando Public Library in 1923 and the Municipal Auditorium (now Bob Carr Auditorium) in 1926. During the Great Depression of the 1930s, the federal government's Works Progress Administration programs aided in the upgrading of the Municipal Airport, the building of a new football stadium at Tinker Field, and park development, and by 1944 many new jobs had been created. Another building boom followed World War II, and new suburbs, new roadways, and new shopping centres were built.</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The development of Walt Disney World in 1971 spurred a construction boom that included apartment buildings, hotels and motels, banks, commercial shopping areas, and tourist-related businesses. The city's Municipal Justice Building was erected in 1972 and Sea World of Florida followed in 1973. Tourism increased, thanks to tourist sites such as Epcot Center built in 1982, and the Disney-MGM Studios theme park, which opened in 1989. To the dismay of many local people, what had once been a sleepy backwater town was rapidly becoming a world class tourist mecca. The town of Orlando was recognized as one of the world's most popular vacation sites.</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>3. Area &amp; Population</strong></p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Orlando is a city in the U.S State of Florida, and the county seat of Orange County. Located in the centre of the Orlando metropolitan area, it is the 24<sup>th</sup> largest metropolitan area in the United States, the sixth-largest metropolitan area in the Southern United States. The geography of Orlando is mostly wetlands, consisting of many lakes and swamps. The terrain is generally flat, making the land fairly low and wet. The area is dotted with hundreds of lakes, the largest of which is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Apopka">Lake Apopka</a>. Central Florida's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bedrock">bedrock</a> is mostly <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limestone">limestone</a> and very porous; the Orlando area is susceptible to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinkholes">sinkholes</a>. Probably the most famous incident involving a sinkhole happened in 1981 in Winter Park, a city immediately north of downtown Orlando, dubbed &ldquo;The Winter Park Sinkhole&rdquo;.</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;">There are 115 neighbourhoods within the city limits of Orlando and many unincorporated communities. Orlando's city limits resemble a checkerboard, with pockets of unincorporated Orange County surrounded by city limits.</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The city&rsquo;s population is estimated to be around 271,000 in 2015 with 57.6% of the population is White. Hispanic/ or Latino took 28.4% of the population, 25% of the city is African American, whereas those from Asian ancestry living in the city took 3.8% of the total population, and the rest are Native American, Pacific Islander, and multiracial.</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>4. Facts &amp; Figures</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Orlando has earned a number of nicknames over the years, including City Phenomenal, and City Different. Today, it&rsquo;s commonly referred to as the City Beautiful.</li>\n<li>A whopping 62 million people visited Orlando in 2014, helping it shoot past Las Vegas to become the most-visited tourist destination in the United States.</li>\n<li>Encompassing more than 40 square miles, Walt Disney World Resort is so enormous that all of Manhattan (33.7 square miles) could easily squeeze within its confines.</li>\n<li>Orlando has long been a popular location for filming movies including &ldquo;Jaws 3&rdquo;, &ldquo;My Girl&rdquo;, &ldquo;Parenthood&rdquo;, &ldquo;Problem Child 2&rdquo;, &ldquo;Lethal Weapon&rdquo;, &ldquo;Dead Presidents&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Waterboy&rdquo;.</li>\n<li>Both boybands Backstreet Boys and N*Sync started in Orlando.</li>\n<li>More than 100 lakes dot Orlando&rsquo;s environs. But in a case of mistaken identity, Lake Eola, one the region&rsquo;s most famous bodies of water, is actually a massive sinkhole measuring 80 feet at its deepest point.</li>\n<li>The Citrus Bowl was the site of five 1994 World Cup soccer matches and also hosted the 1996 Olympic soccer first and second rounds.</li>\n<li>Showcase of Citrus is a working citrus farm just west of Walt Disney World, and in nearby Lake Wales is Florida's Natural Growers, where Florida orange juice is made.</li>\n<li>Gatorland was the first theme park to open in Orlando in 1949. Its main attraction was a 15-foot gator, said to the biggest in the world.</li>\n<li>Among the original rides at the Magic Kingdom were Jungle Cruise, Pirates of the Caribbean, the Carousel of Progress, the Mark Twain Riverboat, It's a Small World, Tomorrowland Speedway, Dumbo the Flying Elephant, the Carousel, Mad Tea Party, Swiss Family Treehouse, the Country Bear Jamboree and the Enchanted Tiki Room, all of which are around today.</li>\n<li>The Wizarding World of Harry Potter opened at Universal&rsquo;s Island of Adventures in 2010. Disney had the rights to Harry Potter first, but sources say J.K. Rowling went with Universal for better collaboration.</li>\n</ul>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>5. Weather</strong></p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Orlando has a humid subtropical climate and transitional climate similar to Tampa. There are two major seasons each year. One is hot and rainy, lasting from May until late September (roughly coinciding with the Atlantic hurricane season). The other is the dry, relatively mild season (late October through April) bringing less frequent rainfall, yet still with warm temperatures.</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;">During the height of Orlando's humid summer season, high temperatures are typically in the lower to mid-90s &deg;F (32&ndash;36&nbsp;&deg;C), while low temperatures rarely fall below 70&nbsp;&deg;F (21&nbsp;&deg;C). During September, strong afternoon thunderstorms occur almost daily. These storms are caused by air masses from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_of_Mexico">Gulf of Mexico</a> and the Atlantic Ocean colliding over Central Florida. They are highlighted by spectacular <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightning">lightning</a> and can also bring heavy rain (sometimes several inches per hour) and powerful winds as well as occasional damaging <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hail">hail</a>.</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;">During the cooler seasons, humidity is lower and temperatures are more moderate, and can fluctuate more readily. The monthly daily average temperature in January is 60.2&nbsp;&deg;F (15.7&nbsp;&deg;C).&nbsp; Because the winter season is dry and freezing temperatures usually occur only after cold fronts (and their accompanying precipitation) have passed, snow is exceptionally rare.</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>6.

Coral reefs not only support a vast array of marine organisms, but also help provide natural protective barriers that guard against coastal erosion. However, these stony natural wonders are undergoing numerous threats, including bleaching, disease and invasive predators. Reduced growth and death of coral reefs are often the result of coastal development, changing climate, and acidification of the ocean&rsquo;s delicate chemistry. In an effort to reverse the decline of shrinking Bahamian reefs, Disney is collaborating with experts in the Caribbean and investing in comprehensive study and training, as well as taking action to create coral nurseries, limit harmful human contact around existing reefs and promote reef rehabilitation and ecosystem resilience.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><em><u>Dumbo the Flying Elephant</u></em>:</strong> Hop atop Dumbo and take off into the air on a joyful journey amid the jubilant sounds of carnival music.

Introduction</strong></p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Located on the island of Oahu&rsquo;s south sore, Honolulu is the vibrant epicenter of Hawaii. This capital and largest city of Hawaii is where you&rsquo;ll find everything from historic landmarks, treasured monuments to flourishing arts, and cultural scene.

History of Foundation</strong></p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The name Honolulu means &ldquo;sheltered bay&rdquo; or &ldquo;peace of shelter&rdquo; in Hawaiian, and its natural harbor catapulted this humble village to importance in 1809, shortly after King Kamehameta I conquered Oahu in order to unite the Hawaiian Islands under the Kingdom of Hawaii, that he moved his royal court form the island of Hawaii to Oahu.&nbsp;</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Honolulu's ideally located port made the city a perfect stop for merchant ships traveling between North America and Asia, and through the 1800s, descendants of missionaries who arrived in the early 1800s established their headquarters in Honolulu, making it the centre of business and the main seaport for the Hawaiian Islands.</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The late 1800s and early 1900s brought the overthrow of the Hawaiian monarchy and subsequent annexation by the United States. Under American rule, Honolulu saw the rise of tourism and the first hotels were constructed in Waikiki. American rule also brought the U.S. military, which built numerous bases in the islands, not least of which was nearby Pearl Harbor; now famous for the surprise attack by the Japanese in 1941, which brought the U.S. into World War II in the Pacific.</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Statehood for the islands brought rapid economic growth to Honolulu, with all the state's major businesses headquartered in the city, the Honolulu airport as the primary entrance point for visitors, and Waikiki as the centre of the island's tourism industry.

The relaxed dress code then circled around the rest of the country.</li>\n<li>Nicole Kidman, the infamous Australian actress was actually born in Honolulu.

Weather</strong></p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Honolulu experiences a hot semi-arid climate with a mostly dry summer season, due to a rain shadow effect. Temperatures vary little throughout the months, with average high temperatures of 80&ndash;90&nbsp;&deg;F (27&ndash;32&nbsp;&deg;C) and average lows of 65&ndash;75&nbsp;&deg;F (18&ndash;24&nbsp;&deg;C) throughout the year.

Attractions</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Hanauma Bay</strong> &ndash; one of the most famous places on the entire island for snorkeling. Hanauma Bay is located on the very east side of Honolulu, near an area of town called Hawaii Kai. The bay, sunken into a crater with a gorgeous stretch of golden sand, is a nature reserve and marine sanctuary. Hanauma is one of the most popular tourist destinations on the Island and has suffered somewhat from overuse (at one time accommodating over three million visitors per year). In 1956, dynamite was used to clear portions of the reef to make room for telephone cables linking Hawaii to the west coast of the US.<br />Snorkeling is the most popular activity on Hanauma Bay. Swimming just above the coral rocks and spotting amazing sea creatures is a relaxing and enjoyable way to spend the day on the island of Oahu. There is at least one company on the beach that rents snorkeling equipment and provides lessons for beginners. Even the most inexperienced snorkeler can have a great time swimming with the Hawaiian wildlife in Hanauma Bay.</li>\n</ol>\n<ol start="2">\n<li><strong>Diamond Head</strong> - the iconic former volcano that stands proud at the far eastern side of Waikiki, and is often an emblem of visiting Honolulu. The volcano provides a great backdrop to all your beach photos from Waikiki, but the view is even better when you&rsquo;re on the very top of it.<br />The Diamond Head crater was formerly used as military base on Oahu, but is now open to the public for recreational use. The hike is just under a mile in length, and takes about 20 &ndash; 30 minutes to reach the summit. At first the trail is easy, then you come to a series of switchbacks where you start gaining elevation, and finally towards the end, you pass through a military tunnel, go up a few flights of stairs, and emerge through a bunker.</li>\n</ol>\n<ol start="3">\n<li><strong>Honolulu Zoo</strong> &ndash; located on the east side of Waikiki, the Honolulu Zoo is the only zoo within a radius of 2,392 miles. It is also the only zoo in the United States that originated in a King&rsquo;s grant of royal lands to the people. The 300 acre parcel was primarily a marshland of old fish ponds, lagoons and islands. In 1877, it was officially opened as Queen Kapiolani Park. Appointed Park Association members developed the unpromising land with the help of royal subsidies to display the King&rsquo;s private bird collection and to feature a horseracing track.<br />The modern Honolulu Zoo originated in 1984, when a second Master Plan was developed for a Tropical Zoological Garden. It organized all exhibits into three tropical ecological zones: the African Savanna, Asian and American Tropical Forests, and Pacific Islands. The zoo is spread out over 42 acres and is home to 905 different animals, most of the them natives of tropical climates. Don&rsquo;t miss the komodo dragon or the orangutan!<br />Along with the diversity of different animals at the Honolulu Zoo, the grounds are also neatly designed with many different lush tropical gardens, showcasing a variety of native Hawaiian plants and flowers.</li>\n</ol>\n<ol start="4">\n<li><strong>Waikiki Aquarium</strong> - Founded in 1904 and administered by the University of Hawaii since 1919, the Waikiki Aquarium is located on the shoreline of Waikiki Beach next to a living reef and across from Kapiolani Park.

The building has been restored to its former glory and is a great place to experience Hawaiian history. The palace was the residence of Hawaii's royalty until they were deposed by American settlers in 1893. It then served as the state capitol until the modern one was constructed in 1969. The palace was restored in the 1970s and opened as a museum in 1978. The interior boasts elaborate wood paneling and carving of native woods like Koa and several imported species. The throne room still has the original carved throne and chandelier. Stained glass and elaborate decorations grace the fa&ccedil;ade.<br />Located in the palace grounds are the Royal Barracks where the king's bodyguards lived. Originally built in 1871 close to the site of the present Hawaii State Capitol, the barracks only moved to their current position when the Capitol was built. The building resembles medieval battlements with embrasures, which appear somewhat odd in these surroundings. The palace is listed on the National Register of Historic Places</li>\n</ol>\n<ol start="6">\n<li><strong>Manoa Falls &amp; Lyon Arboretum</strong> &ndash; is a waterfall located in the Manoa Valley in Honolulu. The Manoa Falls is 150-foot waterfall that empties into a small pool of water.

The Arboretum maintains a number of theme gardens that visitors can easily wander through. Among these are an herb and spice garden, bromeliad garden, the Beatrice H. Krauss Hawaiian Ethnobotanical Garden, and many others.

On these famous shores, the past and the future are uniting in fresh and surprising ways.</li>\n</ol>\n<ol start="8">\n<li><strong>Pearl Harbor, USS Arizona</strong> - not so much an attraction in Honolulu, but rather a memorial. It was on the morning of December 7th, 1941, when Japanese aircraft made a surprise bomb attack on the US ships anchored in Honolulu&rsquo;s Pearl Harbor. During the deadly attack, many lives were lost, and many ships were destroyed. It was after this attack, when the US declared war on Japan and entered into World War II.<br />When you arrive at Pearl Harbor and the USS Arizona Memorial, you get a ticket with a time on it. When it&rsquo;s your turn, you meet your group and first watch a 30 minutes&rsquo; film which explains the history of what happened at Pearl Harbor.<br />After the film, you board a ferry for a short 5 minutes&rsquo; ferry ride to the USS Arizona Memorial, which is a white platform that floats above the sunken ship. You spend about 15 minutes on the platform, respecting the location and the events that happened right there years ago.</li>\n</ol>\n<ol start="9">\n<li><strong>Queen Emma Summer Palace</strong> - The white colonial mansion, built in 1848, was a summer home for King Kamehameha IV and Queen Emma. The museum contains koa furniture and quilts as well as Emma's wedding dress.<br />The house consists of six rooms, with the one across the back added in 1865 to accommodate the Duke of Edinburgh during his visit. The room's highlight is a Gothic curved glass cabinet given by Queen Victoria for the wedding of the royal couple. It was made in Germany from Koa logs shipped from Hawaii.<br />The front parlour room has a round dining table in an early mission style and is one of the only pieces remaining from John Young II, a missionary who built the house and left it to Queen Emma. The 1865 baby grand piano was picked up on the royal family's grand tour of Europe. The rosewood bookcases display symbols of royalty such as a woman's feather cape and a chief's helmet made of roots. The front bedroom across the hall contains an 1842 four-poster bed made of Koa wood, a sleigh bed with a crown, and a cradle in the shape of a canoe decorated with shells. Three rooms across the middle of the house display Hawaiian feather capes, one of which contains 100,000 feathers, wooden bowls, glass, silver, jewellery, and tapa cloths. The house has been a museum since 1913 and is operated by the Daughters of Hawaii. While the King and Queen had six houses, this is one of only two which remain standing.</li>\n</ol>\n<ol start="10">\n<li><strong>Foster Botanical Garden</strong> &ndash; established in 1853, it is the oldest botanical garden in Hawaii.

55	Attractions		\N	<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>1. History</strong></p>\n<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><strong>&bull; Heritage Trails</strong>: The heritage trails in Massachusetts paint vivid pictures of days past, and they are also a great way to explore parts of the state you may not otherwise think to visit. Freedom Trail is the most famous heritage trail, beginning on Boston Common, where hordes of ted-clad British troops once trained, the red-brick Freedom Trail connects 16 Boston landmarks. The Black Heritage Trail is also popular as it explores the history of Boston&rsquo;s 19<sup>th</sup> century African-American community. The Salem Heritage Trail is a North Shore favourite, because it transports you back to the Salem Witch Trials of 1692, and the days of sea captains, pirates and noted novelist Nathaniel Hawthorne.</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><strong>&bull; Lighthouses:</strong> Lighthouses in Massachusetts were once trusted tools for navigation at sea. Today, they are windows into a nautical past, filled with folklore and stories of shipwrecks, heroism, romance, and even ghosts. Boston Light, established in 1716, is the oldest lighthouse in America. Highland Light on Cape Cod, the first light seen on a voyage from Europe to Boston. Race Point Light, in Provincetown, is open to the public for overnight stays.</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><strong>&bull; Civil War:</strong></p>\n<p style="padding-left: 90px;"><strong>○&nbsp;</strong><u>Faneuil Hall</u>: Often referred to as &ldquo;the home of free speech&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Cradle of Liberty&rdquo;, Faneuil Hall hosted America&rsquo;s first Town Meeting. The Hall&rsquo;s vital role in revolutionary politics had not been part of its original plans, but it became home to an intricate collection of events that shaped the nation&rsquo;s history. Built by wealthy merchant Peter Faneuil as a centre of commerce in 1741, this is where the Sons of Liberty proclaimed their dissent against Royal oppression. Faneuil Hall has served as an open forum meeting hall and marketplace for more than 270 years and has continued to provide a forum for debate on the most consequential issues of the day.</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 90px;">○&nbsp;<u>Boston African-American National Historic Site</u>: is comprised of the largest area of pre-Civil War black owned structures in the U.S. The African American community of 19<sup>th</sup> century Boston led the city and the nation in the fight against slavery and injustice. These remarkable men and women, together with their allies, were leaders in Abolition Movement, the Underground Railroad, the Civil War, and the early struggle for equal rights and education.</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 90px;">○&nbsp;<u>Charlestown Navy Yard:</u> served as the starting point of many sailors&rsquo; Civil War journeys. Some of the Union&rsquo;s most celebrated vessels were built on this site, including the steam frigate Merrimack (later captured by the Confederacy), the screw sloop Hartford, and the double-turreted monitor Monadnock. The yard also supported squadrons blockading Southern ports and harbours.

The Museum is a compelling destination that inspires all visitors to reflect on the complex issues that shaped the past, remain critical today, and inform a sustainable future.</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 90px;">○&nbsp;<u>Salem Witch Museum</u>: examines one of the most enduring and emotional events in American History &ndash; the Witch Trials of 1692. The main presentation is based on actual trial documents. You will experience the drama of that dark time through thirteen life-size stage sets, figures, lighting and a stirring narration as they are witness to the web of lies and intrigue of the Salem Witch Hunt. There are also live guides to take you through changing interpretations of witches, the truth behind the stereotypes, witchcraft practice today and the frightening phenomenon of witch hunting.</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 90px;">○&nbsp;<u>JFK Hyannis Museum:</u> dedicated to preserving the memories of John F.

60	Gastronomy		\N	<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>1. Must-eat in Miami</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Arepas:</strong> think a flattened, pancake like grilled cheese and add some Colombian and Venezuelan flare. Arepas are made with a maize-like dough, stuffed with cheese, most commonly, and cooked until the dough reaches a golden brown. (at <em><u>La Latina Miami - 3509 NE 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33137</u></em>)</li>\n<li><strong>Biskits</strong>: a honey, apple cider glaze and a dash of Maldon. (at <em><u>The Fed - 5132 Biscayne Blvd, FL 33137</u></em>)</li>\n<li><strong>Caf&eacute; con Leche y Tostada Cubana</strong>: Nothing gets more simple, or classic, than cafe con leche and grilled bread. Similar to a cafe latte, the brew is instead made with Cuban coffee, an intense dose of espresso with what will seem like equal parts sugar. The buttered, Cuban bread can then be eaten alongside or dunked in the coffee to for a sweet and creamy pick-me up. (at <em><u>David&rsquo;s Caf&eacute; - 8718 SW 40th St, Miami, FL 33165</u></em>)</li>\n<li><strong>Ceviche</strong>: One of the most versatile dishes, ceviche consists of three parts: fish, acid, spice. Anything else is strictly embellishment. This Peruvian dish has been transformed into an American staple and is a must have for every menu card along a coastline. It's as classic Miami as white linen pants. (at <em><u>My Ceviche Brickell - 1250 S Miami Ave, Miami, FL 33130</u></em>)</li>\n<li><strong>Croquetas</strong>: Ham, cheese, chorizo, and chicken can all be found stuffed within Miami's best croquetas. Technically anything that is a minced or smashed into a small disk or cylinder then breaded and fried is a croqueta. Surprisingly enough, this includes crab cakes and mozzarella sticks. In Miami, you can find them in restaurants and bakeries just as often as you can along boardwalks.</li>\n<li><strong>Cuban Mojo</strong>: In Miami, Cuban mojo is on piled on everything. Most commonly made with garlic, sour orange juice, and occasionally olive oil, the sauce can act as a marinade for&nbsp;barbecuing or even a condiment in sandwiches that adds a zesty, garlic kick.</li>\n<li><strong>Cuban Sandwich</strong>: Miami&rsquo;s most iconic dish. A true collaboration between Cuban migrant workers and Floridians in the late 1800s and the early 20th century, this spin on the old ham and cheese is most often found simply with fresh Cuban bread, yellow mustard, roasted pork, baked ham, Swiss cheese, and sliced dill pickles.&nbsp;(at <em><u>Versailles Restaurant - 3555 SW 8th St, Miami, FL 33135</u></em>)</li>\n<li><strong>Deviled Eggs</strong>: a perfect snack menu item that takes a boring hard-boiled egg up several notches and transforms it into a delicious and delicate dish. The precisely cooked egg yolk is removed from the egg white and classically mixed with mayonnaise, Dijon mustard, lemon juice, and a touch of hot sauce. Once the mixture is complete, it is pipetted back into the egg white &lsquo;casing,&rsquo; ready to be served. (at <em><u>Michael&rsquo;s Genuine Food &amp; Drink - 130 NE 40th St, Miami, FL 33137</u></em>)</li>\n<li><strong>Fritas</strong>: a Cuban take on burger that has national appeal. A little spiced, ground beef, a little mojo, a few onions, and some shoestring potatoes, you have a frita. If it's a good enough grab for Obama while visiting the Magic City, then it's a good enough grab for you. (<em><u>at El Mago de las Fritas - 5828 SW 8th St, West Miami, FL 33144</u></em>)</li>\n<li><strong>Mofongo</strong>: a Puerto Rican speciality that is as beloved in Miami as it is in its hometown, featuring a small mountain made of fried plantains, garlic, and chicharrones that have all been smashed and molded together in a wooden mortar and pestle known as a pilon. Different variations can be made by adding seafood, chicken, pork, or broth.</li>\n<li><strong>Stone Crab Claws</strong>: Served cracked and chilled on ice, Florida Stone Crab claws can vary in size between 2.75 inches length to over a colossal 2 pounds. The&nbsp;sweet, lobster-esque meat needs little seasoning, yet is still&nbsp;classically served with hash browns, cole slaw, lemon, and mayo, butter, or tartar sauce. (at <em><u>Joe&rsquo;s Stone Crab - 11 Washington Ave, Miami Beach, FL 33139</u></em>)</li>\n</ul>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>2.

The crawfish &mdash; which look like tiny lobsters &mdash; are boiled in water seasoned with a mix of hot spices, along with corn on the cob and potatoes. Pinch the sides of the shell and pop off the head, and then suck the sweet, spicy tail flesh. (best at Felix&rsquo;s Restaurant &amp; Oyster Bar &ndash; 739 Iberville Street, New Orleans, LA 70130)</li>\n<li><em><u>Jambalaya</u></em>: jambalaya is a traditional Creole dish that combines rice with vegetables and some type of meat, usually chicken and andouille sausage &mdash; think of jambalaya as the Crescent City's version of paella. (best at Jacques Imo&rsquo;s Caf&eacute; - 8324 Oak Street, New Orleans, LA)</li>\n<li><em><u>Fried Chicken</u></em>: Fried chicken is a staple in the South, and New Orleans hosts many variants of this comfort-food favourite. New Orleanians love their fried chicken to be tender and juicy on the inside, and fried to a crunchy, crispy perfection on the outside.</li>\n<li><em><u>Barbecue Shrimp</u></em>: Despite the name, there's no barbecue involved in barbecue shrimp, with the shrimp sauteed in a Worcestershire, garlic and butter sauce that is melt-in-your-mouth fantastic. (best at Pascal&rsquo;s Manale Restaurant &ndash; <strong>1838 Napoleon Ave, New Orleans, LA 70115)</strong></li>\n<li><strong><em><u>Pralines</u></em></strong><strong>: </strong>A sinfully sweet fudge-like dessert, pralines are made from a combination of syrup and pecans and/or hazelnuts, softened with a bit of cream. (best at Aunt Sally&rsquo;s)</li>\n<li><em><u>Red Beans and Rice</u></em>: A New Orleans tradition around Mardi Gras time, red beans and rice are as close to a Southern staple as you're likely to find. There's a lot more to this dish than just beans, and everyone has his or her unique version of what is essentially red beans simmered with andouille sausage, rice, Creole seasoning and, for some, ham hocks. (best at Joey K&rsquo;s Restaurant, and Bar in the Garden District)</li>\n</ul>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>2. Iconic Restaurants</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><em><u>Shaya (Uptown):</u></em> From the perfect, pillowy pita cooked in the custom-built pizza oven to the best hummus you&rsquo;ve ever had in your life (no hyperbole, the best), creamy labneh, salty ikra (paddlefish roe), to the insane pomegranate-lacquered lamb, it&rsquo;s easy to see why this is the most coveted reservation in town right now. Don&rsquo;t overlook its lunch, either; the chicken schnitzel on sesame challah is outstanding. (4213 Magazine St, New Orleans, LA 70115)</li>\n<li><em><u>Angeline (French Quarter):</u></em> wins for its deceptive simplicity, while courting complex flavors, all in a charming Vieux Carre environment. The Southern fried quail, Georgia clams with wild boar sausage, and creamy oyster pan roast are outstanding starters, while the Mississippi rabbit milanese and blue crab linguini with Florida bottarga are entrees that are not to be missed. (1032 Chartres St, New Orleans, LA 70116)</li>\n<li><em><u>Compere Lapin (Warehouse District):</u></em> opened by Top Chef New Orleans contestant Nina Compton, the restaurant is specializing in Creole suisine. The Caribbean influence and Compton&rsquo;s fastidious technique -- big flavors in tight packages -- not to mention one of the best new cocktail bars in the city. If you can&rsquo;t get a table, you can always be satisfied with drinks and snacks here, especially the spiced pig ears and the dirty rice arancini. (535 Tchoupitoulas St, New Orleans, LA 70130).</li>\n<li><em><u>MOPHO (Mid-City):</u></em> The razor clams, those crispy oysters with pickled blue cheese and nuoc cham mayo, the house-grown exotic herbs, the whole roasted pig every Saturday. It&rsquo;s all just out of sight, and in a fun, casual package that includes a great bar program and friendly service. (514 City Park Ave, New Orleans, LA 70119)</li>\n<li><em><u>Trenasse</u></em>: inside the Intercontinental Hotel on St. Charles Ave, this place is a haven for Gulf seafood preparations, both simple and elevated. Oysters are served "all day, all ways," the lunch menu caters to both leisurely dining visitors and folks working in the surrounding office buildings, and dinner focuses on rustic dishes like alligator tamales, speckled trout meuni&egrave;re, and rabbit &amp; shrimp fricassee. (444 St Charles Ave, New Orleans, LA 70130)</li>\n<li><em><u>Peche Seafood Grill (Central Business District):</u></em> P&ecirc;che has redefined ocean-to-table dining in New Orleans, through James Beard award-winning chef Ryan Hewitt&rsquo;s dedication to the freshest seafood prepared in the simplest ways. The raw bar menu is phenomenal, as are the variations on comfort food favorites like fish &amp; chips, and smothered catfish. Really, though, just get the whole-grilled fish of the day, whatever it is. Splitting that with some small plates and side dishes for the table is one of the best ways to enjoy everything that P&ecirc;che -- and the sea -- has to offer. (8000 Magazine St, New Orleans, LA 70130)</li>\n<li><em><u>Rebirth Restaurant (Warehouse District):</u></em> Big flavors and bold choices dominate Rebirth&rsquo;s "farm-to-table Cajun-Creole" menu, where Louisiana native chef Ricky Cheramie serves up crowd-pleasing dishes like Mississippi-style barbecue pork belly, fried oysters over angel hair, and blackened scallops with crawfish &amp; tasso maque choux. It also has a considerable carnivorous side, with its signature double-cut tomahawk pork chop, as well as its steakhouse-style Painted Hills filet mignon and ribeye. (857 Fulton St, New Orleans, LA 70130)</li>\n<li><em><u>The Caribbean Room (Lower Garden District):</u></em> features rattan furniture and white tablecloths and upholds the room&rsquo;s existing Charles Reinike murals. Chef Chris Lusk infuses a fresh, contemporary energy that still evokes the nostalgia of the original restaurant. The Caribbean Room provides a transportive, only in New Orleans experience to all.

However, as set forth below, the preceding sentences will not apply to disputes relating to the interpretation or application of the Class Action Waiver or PAGA Waiver below, including their enforceability, revocability or validity. Except as it otherwise provides, this Arbitration Provision also applies, without limitation, to all disputes between You and the Canarini or our Affiliates, as well as all disputes between You and Canarini&rsquo;s fiduciaries, administrators, affiliates, subsidiaries, parents, and all successors and assigns of any of them, including but not limited to any disputes arising out of or related to this Agreement and disputes arising out of or related to your relationship with the Company, including termination of the relationship.

Nothing in this Arbitration Provision will be deemed to preclude or excuse a party from bringing an administrative claim before any agency in order to fulfill the party's obligation to exhaust administrative remedies before making a claim in arbitration; Disputes that may not be subject to a predispute arbitration agreement pursuant to applicable Federal law or Executive Order are excluded from the coverage of this Arbitration Provision; Disputes regarding your or Canarini&rsquo;s intellectual property rights; This Arbitration Provision will not be construed to require the arbitration of any claims against a contractor that may not be the subject of a mandatory arbitration agreement as provided by section 8116 of the Department of Defense ("DoD") Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2010 (Pub. L. 111-118), section 8102 of the Department of Defense ("DoD") Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2011 (Pub. L. 112-10, Division A), and their implementing regulations, or any successor DoD appropriations act addressing the arbitrability of claims.</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><strong>8. Selecting The Arbitrator and Location of the Arbitration.</strong></p>\n<p style="padding-left: 60px;">The Arbitrator will be selected by mutual agreement of Canarini and you. Unless you and the Canarini mutually agree otherwise, the Arbitrator will be an attorney licensed to practice in the location where the arbitration proceeding will be conducted or a retired federal or state judicial officer who presided in the jurisdiction where the arbitration will be conducted. If the Parties cannot agree on an Arbitrator, then an arbitrator will be selected using the alternate strike method from a list of five (5) neutral arbitrators provided by JAMS (Judicial Arbitration &amp; Mediation Services). You will have the option of making the first strike. If a JAMS arbitrator is used, then the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules &amp; Procedures rules will apply; however, if there is a conflict between the JAMS Rules and this Agreement, this Agreement will govern. Those rules are available here: <a href="http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-streamlined-arbitration/">http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-streamlined-arbitration/</a> The location of the arbitration proceeding will be no more than 45 miles from the place where you last provided Tour Guide Provider services under this Agreement, unless each party to the arbitration agrees in writing otherwise.</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><strong>9. Starting The Arbitration.</strong></p>\n<p style="padding-left: 60px;">All claims in arbitration are subject to the same statutes of limitation that would apply in court. The party bringing the claim must demand arbitration in writing and deliver the written demand by hand or first class mail to the other party within the applicable statute of limitations period. The demand for arbitration will include identification of the Parties, a statement of the legal and factual basis of the claim(s), and a specification of the remedy sought. Any demand for arbitration made to the Company or Canarini will be provided to Canarini Tour Guides LLC, Legal, 19 W. 34<sup>th</sup> Street, Suite 1018, New York, NY 10001. The arbitrator will resolve all disputes regarding the timeliness or propriety of the demand for arbitration. A party may apply to a court of competent jurisdiction for temporary or preliminary injunctive relief in connection with an arbitrable controversy, but only upon the ground that the award to which that party may be entitled may be rendered ineffectual without such provisional relief.</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><strong>10. How Arbitration Proceedings Are Conducted. Class Action Waiver. Private Attorneys General Act.</strong></p>\n<p style="padding-left: 60px;">In arbitration, the Parties will have the right to conduct adequate civil discovery, bring dispositive motions, and present witnesses and evidence as needed to present their cases and defenses, and any disputes in this regard will be resolved by the Arbitrator.</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 60px;">You and the Company agree to resolve any dispute that is in arbitration on an individual basis only, and not on a class, collective action, or representative basis (&ldquo;Class Action Waiver&rdquo;). The Arbitrator will have no authority to consider or resolve any claim or issue any relief on any basis other than an individual basis. The Arbitrator will have no authority to consider or resolve any claim or issue any relief on a class, collective, or representative basis. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Arbitration Provision or the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules &amp; Procedures, disputes regarding the enforceability, revocability or validity of the Class Action Waiver may be resolved only by a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator. In any case in which (1) the dispute is filed as a class, collective, or representative action and (2) there is a final judicial determination that all or part of the Class Action Waiver unenforceable, the class, collective, and/or representative action to that extent must be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction, but the portion of the Class Action/ Waiver that is enforceable will be enforced in arbitration. While the Company will not take any retaliatory action in response to any exercise of rights you may have under Section 7 of the National Labor Relations Act, if any, the Company will not be precluded from moving to enforce its rights under the FAA to compel arbitration on the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement.</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><strong>Private Attorneys General Act.</strong></p>\n<p style="padding-left: 60px;">Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement or the Arbitration Provision, to the extent permitted by law, (1) You and Company agree not to bring a representative action on behalf of others under the Private Attorneys General Act of 2004 (&ldquo;PAGA&rdquo;), California Labor Code &sect; 2698 et seq., in any court or in arbitration, and (2) for any claim brought on a private attorney general basis&mdash;i.e., where you are seeking to pursue a claim on behalf of a government entity&mdash;both you and Company agree that any such dispute will be resolved in arbitration on an individual basis only (i.e., to resolve whether you have personally been aggrieved or subject to any violations of law), and that such an action may not be used to resolve the claims or rights of other individuals in a single or collective proceeding (i.e., to resolve whether other individuals have been aggrieved or subject to any violations of law) (&ldquo;PAGA Waiver&rdquo;). Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement or the Arbitration Provision, the validity of the PAGA Waiver may be resolved only by a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator. If any provision of the PAGA Waiver is found to be unenforceable or unlawful for any reason, (1) the unenforceable provision will be severed from this Agreement; (2) severance of the unenforceable provision will have no impact whatsoever on the Arbitration Provision or the Parties&rsquo; attempt to arbitrate any remaining claims on an individual basis pursuant to the Arbitration Provision; and (3) any representative action brought under PAGA on behalf of others must be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not in arbitration. To the extent that there are any claims to be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction because a civil court of competent jurisdiction determines that the PAGA Waiver is unenforceable with respect to those claims, the Parties agree that litigation of those claims will be stayed pending the outcome of any individual claims in arbitration.&nbsp;</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><strong>11. Paying For The Arbitration.</strong></p>\n<p style="padding-left: 60px;">Each party will pay the fees for his, her or its own attorneys, subject to any remedies to which that party may later be entitled under applicable law (i.e., a party prevails on a claim that provides for the award of reasonable attorney fees to the prevailing party). In all cases where required by law, Canarini will pay the Arbitrator's and arbitration fees. If under applicable law the Canarini is not required to pay all of the Arbitrator&rsquo;s and/or arbitration fees, such fee(s) will be apportioned equally between the Parties or as otherwise required by applicable law. However, you will not be required to bear any type of fee or expense that you would not be required to bear if you had filed the action in a court of law. Any disputes in that specific instance will be resolved by the Arbitrator as soon as practicable after the Arbitrator is selected, and Canarini will bear all of the Arbitrator&rsquo;s and arbitration fees until such time as the Arbitrator resolves any such dispute.</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><strong>12. The Arbitration Hearing And Award.</strong></p>\n<p style="padding-left: 60px;">The Parties will arbitrate their dispute before the Arbitrator, who will confer with the Parties regarding the conduct of the hearing and resolve any disputes the Parties may have in that regard. Within 30 days of the close of the arbitration hearing, or within a longer period of time as agreed to by the Parties or as ordered by the Arbitrator, any party will have the right to prepare, serve on the other party and file with the Arbitrator a brief. The Arbitrator may award any party any remedy to which that party is entitled under applicable law, but such remedies will be limited to those that would be available to a party in his or her individual capacity in a court of law for the claims presented to and decided by the Arbitrator, and no remedies that otherwise would be available to an individual in a court of law will be forfeited by virtue of this Arbitration Provision. The Arbitrator will issue a decision or award in writing, stating the essential findings of fact and conclusions of law. A court of competent jurisdiction will have the authority to enter a judgment upon the award made pursuant to the arbitration. The Arbitrator will not have the power to commit errors of law or legal reasoning, and the award may be vacated or corrected on appeal to a court of competent jurisdiction for any such error.</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><strong>13. Your Right To Opt Out Of Arbitration.</strong></p>\n<p style="padding-left: 60px;">Arbitration is not a mandatory condition of your contractual relationship with the Company.

58	General Information		\N	<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>1. Introduction</strong></p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;">A little more than a century ago, a city sprung up almost overnight. As a result, one of Miami&rsquo;s many nicknames is the Magic City. Much like its geographical description, Miami is surging as a major international port and a gateway for global industries establishing footholds in the U.S.</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;">With great year-round weather, top-ranked beaches and the sparkling waters of Biscayne Bay as the backdrops for a cosmopolitan metropolis and pulsing rhythms of diversity, Miami is definitely sitting on top of the bucket&rsquo;s lists of destination to visit.</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>2. History of Foundation</strong></p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The Miami area was inhabited for thousands of years by Indigenous cultures. The Tequestas had been there with their village of hundreds of people dating back to 500-600 B.C at the mouth of the Miami River. Later, Juan Ponce de Leon was the first European to visit in 1513 and Spain is credited for the first recorded landing in 1566. Shortly after the Spanish rule established a mission on the river&rsquo;s north bank, the Tequestas were targeted for conversion to Christianity. The attempt failed and a majority of the tribe, disease-stricken with small pox and other illnesses died.</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The attack of the United States land expansion to displace and relocate American Indians brought large migrations of Native Americans around the late 1700&rsquo;s to South Florida. After Florida was ceded to the United States and purchased from Spain in 1819, three major wars were waged by the Seminoles against the U.S. Government. The Miami area was devastated by the second ward and was known as one of the worst events in American history. These wars attributed for the slow settlement of Miami until 1842.</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Then, William English charted the &ldquo;Village of Miami&rdquo; and the village was established on the south bank of the Miami River. One the north side of the river, Julia Tuttle, a wealthy widow from Ohio, purchased a large citrus plantation in addition to a plot she inherited. She had envisioned the City as a gateway for international trade. By April 1896, the railroad tracks reached Miami and in July a meeting was held to incorporate the city. The right to vote was restricted to men and a third of the voters were Bahamian immigrants. The City was incorporated in 1896 with 444 citizens under the name of &ldquo;The City of Miami&rdquo;.</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Along with the railroad, Flagler financed and built streets, water and power systems and a resort hotel. Canals were made to drain water from the everglades that covered a majority of the land. It was no surprise that Miami soon became an instant tourist attraction and retreat for the rich and famous. This prompted the first of many real estate booms.</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;">In 1959, the Cuban dictator Fidel Castro came to power. What followed was a mass exodus of people from Cuba to Miami. Hundreds of thousands of Cubans came to Miami thinking it to be a temporary home until their home was freed from its communistic reign. An invasion of Cuba was planned by the U.S., which became known as &ldquo;The Bay of Pigs&rdquo;, but was disrupted when the Soviet Union threatened the U.S. with warfare. Since the late 1960&rsquo;s, Miami has become a mix of cultural influences &ndash; with mainly Cubans, African-American, and Caribbean.</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>3. Area &amp; Population</strong></p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The City of Miami is located in Southeast Florida in Miami-Dade County on the Miami River, between the Florida Everglades and the Atlantic Ocean. The main portion of the city lies on the shores of Biscayne Bay which contains several hundred natural and artificially created barrier islands, the largest of which contains Miami Beach and South Beach. The Gulf Stream, a warm ocean current, runs northward just 15 miles (24 km) off the coast, allowing the city&rsquo;s climate to stay warm all year.</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Miami is partitioned into North, South, West, and Downtown sections. The heart of the city is Downtown Miami and is technically on the eastern side of the city.&nbsp; Downtown is home to many major banks, courthouses, financial headquarters, cultural and tourist attractions, schools, parks, hospital and medical research centres, and a large residential population. The southern side of Miami includes Coral Way, The Roads and Coconut Grove. The south is where a lot of nightclubs, bars, restaurants and bohemian shops are located. Therefore, it is very popular with local college students. The western side of Miami includes Little Havana, West Flagler, and Flagami, and is home to many of the city&rsquo;s traditionally immigrant neighbourhoods. The northern side of Miami includes Midtown, a district that has a great mix of diversity with West Indians, Hispanics, European Americans, bohemians, and artists. The wealthier residents usually live in the north-eastern part, in Midtown, the Design District, and the Upper East Side.</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The Miami metropolitan area has a population of more than 5.5 million people, ranked seventh largest in the United States, and is the largest metropolitan area in the South-eastern United States. As of 2010, 69.96% of the population are Hispanic that mainly of Cuban origin, 16% are African-American, 11.92% are White, and 1.85% are of Asian ancestry.</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>4.

64	Attractions		\N	<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>1. Haunted New Orleans</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><em><u>The Bourbon Orleans Hotel</u></em>: a notable haunted hotel in the French Quarter. When the building was a convent, the Orleans Ballroom was host to quadroon balls, where men would court local ladies. One ghost is reported to be weeping in the corner for her lover who had promised to marry her but never returned. A male spirit enjoys the company of female visitors, often leaving ladies feeling that the unseen is too close for comfort. The ghosts of children and nuns who perished in a yellow fever epidemic are often seen by guests, particularly the spirit of a little girl rolling her ball down the sixth floor corridor. Additionally, spirits have been known to borrow guests' belongings. One couple received a shock when they found their camera contained pictures of the pair sleeping.</li>\n<li><em><u>Hotel Monteleone</u></em>: While the hotel is most famous for the literary figures it has housed since its establishment in 1886, some of the guests never departed the grand hotel. In March of 2003, the International Society of Paranormal Research made contact with more than a dozen spirits, including a former employee named William Wildmere who died of natural causes in the hotel. Additionally, the spirit of a boy enjoys playing hide-and-seek with another young boy on the fourteenth floor.</li>\n<li><em><u>&ldquo;Cities of the Dead&rdquo;:</u></em> Since the city is below sea level and it doesn't take much digging to hit water, New Orleanians bury their dead above ground. These tombs are often lauded for their architecture, but bodies are not all that reside here. Visitors have heard screams coming from inside tombs and seen the ghosts of cats and dogs. Most famously, St. Louis Cemetery No. 1 is home to Marie Laveau's tomb and is considered the most haunted cemetery in the U.S. Marie Laveau herself is rumored to traipse around the graves mumbling a Santeria curse at trespassers. Voodoo legend says to knock three times on the face of Laveau's grave, mark three X's, knock three times again and make a wish to be blessed by Laveau. Don&rsquo;t forget to leave an offering when you go.</li>\n<li><em><u>Le Petit Theatre</u></em>: America's oldest community theater, is also a haven for the dead. When actors have lost something, they call out to Caroline, one of their most active resident ghosts, asking where it is.

An actress who fell from the catwalk onto the stage is sometimes seen up on the catwalk while the curtain billows of its own accord. With 11 confirmed spirits, including ex-managers, Union soldiers and servants, the theater is chilling when the lights dim for a show.</li>\n<li><em><u>Lafitte&rsquo;s Blacksmith Shop</u></em>: the oldest building used as a bar in the United States, built between 1722 and 1732.

With such a storied history, it's no surprise that the bar is one of the most haunted in America. Visitors often report that the fireplace has a pair of glowing red eyes in the grate, and Jean Lafitte himself is rumored to haunt the building.

71	General Information		\N	<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>1. General introduction</strong></p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Los Angeles, LA, has long been associated with sunny days, fit people, relaxing lifestyle, nice beaches, beautiful celebrities and their million dollars&rsquo; mansions. LA is the entertainment capital of the world, a cultural mecca boasting more than 100 museums, and a paradise good weather. Los Angeles is on the leading edge of several growth industries. LA County, with more than 87,000 jobs in the fashion industry, has surpassed New York&rsquo;s fashion district workforce.</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>2. History of Foundation</strong></p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The history of Los Angeles begins some ten or twenty thousand years before the first Europeans arrived in Southern California. Throughout the vast majority of human history, there was no city of Los Angeles; for thousand years, hunters and gatherers clustered in villages on the shores and the banks of the rivers. Around 1769, when the first Mexican and Spanish settlers arrived, the basin was populated by the Cahuilla, Cupe&ntilde;o, Luise&ntilde;o, and Serrano, speakers of Takic languages, a branch of Northern Uto-Aztec.</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;">A permanent colonial settlement was established on 4<sup>th</sup> September 1781 as El Puelo de Nuestra Se&ntilde;ora de Nuestra Se&ntilde;ora de los Angeles di Porci&uacute;ncula. It was named in honour of the shrine to the Virgin Mary, Santa Maria degli Angeli, Our Lady of the Angels, on the plain below Assis, Saint Francis&rsquo; native village in Italy. The city was built in land on the Rio Porci&uacute;ncula, the broad river through the valley, rather than by the ocean, where it would have been too exposed to attacks. It was constructed in the traditional Spanish style, centered around a rectangle consisting of a city plaza, a guardhouse, a town house, and a granary. The invaders set out to reproduce the characteristic Spanish social arrangements and institutions: the missions, the presidios, the divisions between clergy, the army, and the civil populations. Soldiers and adventures, they married the indigenous women, tracking their offspring by degrees of intermarriage. The colonial imperative defined their agendas: the religious conversion of the indigenous people, the attempted pacification of natives&rsquo; hostile to colonization, the formation, training, and control of a labor force, and the defense of New Spain achieved its independence from the Spanish Empire in 1821, and the pueblo continued as a part of Mexico. During Mexican rule, Governor Pio Pico made Los Angeles Alta California&rsquo;s reginal capital.</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Mexican ruled ended during the Mexican-American War when Americans took control from the Californios after a series of battles, culminating with the singing of the Treaty of Cahuenga on 13<sup>th</sup> January, 1847. Railroads arrived with the completion of the Southern Pacific line to Los Angeles 1876. Oil was discovered in the city and surrounding area in 1892, and by 1923, the discoveries had helped California become the country&rsquo;s largest oil producer, accounting for about one-quarter of the world&rsquo;s petroleum output. In 1910, Hollywood merged into Los Angeles, with 10 movie companies already operating in the city at the time. By 1921, more than 80 percent of the world&rsquo;s film industry was concentrated in L.A. The money generated by the industry kept the city insulted from much of the economic loss suffered by the rest of the country during the Great Depression. By 1930, the population surpassed one million. In 1932, the city hosted the Summer Olympics.</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;">During WWII, Los Angeles was a major center of wartime manufacturing, such as shipbuilding and aircraft. Following the end of WWII, Los Angeles grew more rapidly than ever, sprawling into the San Fernando Valley. The expansion of the Interstate Highway System during the 1950s and 1960s helped propel suburban growth and signaled the demise of the city&rsquo;s electrified rail system, once the world&rsquo;s largest.&nbsp;</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;">In 1984, the city hosted the Summer Olympic Games for the second time.

75	General Information		\N	<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>1. General Introduction about the City:</strong></p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;">New York, New York, a city that never sleeps. Home to the Empire State Building, Times Squares, Statue of Liberty and so much more other iconic sites, the infamous New York city is a fast-paced, globally influential centre of art, culture, fashion and finance. The city of 5 boroughs site where the Hudson River meets the Atlantic Ocean, with the island borough of Manhattan at the &ldquo;Big Apple&rsquo;s&rdquo; core. New York city is a glamorous city where people around the world arrive every year to make their dreams come true.</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>2. History of foundation:</strong></p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;">In 1785, the assembly of the Congress of the Confederation made New York the national capital shortly after the war. New York was the last capital of the U.S under the Articles of Confederation and the first capital under the Constitution of the United States. In 1789, the first President of the United States, George Washington was inaugurated; the first United States Congress and the Supreme Court of the United States each assembled for the first time, and the United States Bill of Rights was drafted, all the Federal Hall on Wall Street. By 1790, New York had surpassed Philadelphia as the largest city in the United States.</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The Great Irish Famine brought a large influx of over 200,00 Irish immigrants living in New York by 1860, upwards of a quarter of the city&rsquo;s population. There was also extensive immigration from the German province, where revolutions had disrupted societies, and German comprised another 25% of New York&rsquo;s population in 1860.</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;">In 1898, the modern City of New York was formed with the consolidation of Brooklyn (until then a separate city), the County of New York (which then included parts of the Bronx), the County of Richmond, and the western portion of the County of Queens. The opening of the subway in 1904, first built as separate private systems, helped bind the new city together. Throughout the first half of the 20<sup>th</sup> century, the city became a world centre for industry, commerce, and communication.</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;">New York became the most populous urbanised area in the world in early 1920s, overtaking London. The metropolitan area surpassed the 10 million mark in the early 1930s, becoming the first megacity in human history. After World War II, New York emerged as the leading city of the world, with Wall Street leading America&rsquo;s place as the world&rsquo;s dominant economic power. The United Nations Headquarters was completed in 1952, solidifying New York&rsquo;s global geopolitical influence, and the rise of abstract expressionism in the city precipitated New York&rsquo;s displacement of Paris as the centre of the art world.</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The city and surrounding area suffered the bulk of economic damage and largest loss of human life in the tragic aftermath of the September 11<sup>th</sup>, 2001 attacks when the terrorist members of Al-Qaeda piloted American Airlines Flight 11 into North Tower of the World Trade Centre and United Airlines Flight 175 into the South Tower of the World Trade Centre, and later destroyed them, killing 2,192 civilians, 343 firefighters, and 71 law enforcement officers who were in the towers and the surrounding area. The rebuilding of the area, has created a new One World Trade Centre, and a 9/11 memorial and museum along with other new buildings and infrastructure. The new One World Trade Centre is the tallest skyscraper in the Western Hemisphere and the fourth-tallest building in the world by pinnacle height, with its spire reaching a symbolic 1,776 feet (541.3m) in reference to the year of American independence.&nbsp;</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>3. Area &amp; Population:</strong></p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;">New York city is situated in the Northeastern United States, approximately halfway between Washington D.C and Boston. The location at the mouth of the Hudson River, which feeds into a naturally sheltered harbour and the into the Atlantic Ocean, has helped the city grow in significance as a trading port. Most of New York City is built on the three islands of Long Island, Manhattan, and Staten Island.</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;">New York City is composed of five boroughs:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><u>Manhattan (New York County)</u></strong> is the geographically smallest and most densely populated borough. The islands are linked by bridges, tunnels and ferries. Manhattan is 13.4 miles long and 2.3 miles wide at its widest. Fifth Avenue divides the island into east and west sides. Manhattan&rsquo;s population density of 72,033 people per square mile (27,812/km&sup2;) in 2015 makes it the highest of any county in the United States and higher than the density of any individual American city. Manhattan is the cultural, administrative, and financial centre of New York City and contains the headquarters of many major multinational corporations, the United Nations Headquarters, Wall Street, and a number of important universities. Manhattan is often described as the financial and cultural centre of the world.</li>\n<li><strong><u>Brooklyn (Kings County):</u></strong> on the western tip of Long Island, is the city&rsquo;s most populous borough. Brooklyn is known for its cultural, social, and ethnic diversity, an independent art scene, distinct neighbourhoods, and a distinctive architectural heritage. Downtown Brooklyn is the only central core neighbourhood in the outer borough. The borough has a long beachfront shoreline including Coney Island, established in the 1870s as one of the earliest amusement grounds in the city. Marine Park and prospect Park are the two largest parks in Brooklyn.</li>\n<li><strong><u>Queens (Queens County):</u></strong> on Long Island north and east of Brooklyn, is geographically the largest borough, the most ethnicity diverse county in the United States, as well as the most ethnically diverse urban area in the world. Historically a collection of small towns and villages founded by the Dutch, the borough has since developed both commercial and residential prominence. Queens is the site of Citi Field, the baseball stadium of the New York Mets, and hosts the annual U.S Open tennis tournament at Flushing Meadows-Corona Park. Additionally, two of the three busiest airports serving the New York metropolitan area, John F. Kennedy International Airport and LaGuardia Airport, are located in Queens. (the third is Newark Liberty International Airport in Newark, New Jersey).</li>\n<li><strong><u>Staten Island (Richmond County)</u></strong> is the most suburban in character of the five borough. Staten Island is connected to Brooklyn by the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge and to Manhattan by way of the free Staten Island Ferry, a daily commuter ferry and popular tourist attraction which provides unobstructed views of the Statue of Liberty, Ellis Island, and Lower Manhattan. In central Staten Island, the Staten Island Greenbelt spans approximately 2,500 acres (10 km&sup2;), including 28 miles (45 km) of walking trails and one of the last undisturbed forests in the city. Designated in 1894 to protect the island&rsquo;s natural lands, the Greenbelt comprises seven city parks.</li>\n<li><strong><u>The Bronx (Bronx County):</u></strong> is New York City&rsquo;s northernmost borough and the only New York borough with a majority of it a part of the mainland Unites States. It is the location of Yankee Stadium, the baseball park of the New York Yankees, and home to the largest cooperatively owned house complex in the United States, Co-op City. It is also home to the Bronx Zoo, the world&rsquo;s largest metropolitan zoo, which spans 265 acres (1.09 km&sup2;) and houses over 6,000 animals. The Bronx is also the birthplace of rap and hip hop culture. Pelham Bay Park is the largest park in New York City, at 2765 acres (1119 ha)</li>\n</ul>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The city population in total is estimated to be around 8.5 billion in 2015</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>4. Facts &amp; Figures:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>New York is nicknamed as The Big Apple. In the early 1920s, &ldquo;apple&rdquo; was used in reference to the many horse racing courses in and around New York City. Apple referred to the prizes being awarded for the races (possibly due to the fact that horses like apples) as these were important races, the rewards were substantial. A writer of the New York Morning Telegraph, John Fitzgerald, referred to New York City&rsquo;s races &ldquo;Around the Big Apple&rdquo;. It is rumoured that Fitzgerald got the term from jockeys and trainers in New Orleans who aspired to race on New York City tracks, referring to the &ldquo;Big Apple&rdquo;.</li>\n<li>Except for emergencies, honking your car is actually illegal in New York City, and yes, everybody does it anyway.</li>\n<li>Manhattan was purchased from the native people in 1626 for the modern equivalent of 1000USD</li>\n<li>It can cost nearly $300,000 to operate a hot dog stand around Central Park. (maybe that&rsquo;s why) New Yorkers bite 10 times more people per year than sharks do.</li>\n<li>New York City doesn&rsquo;t have any Walmart&rsquo;s.</li>\n<li>More Chinese people live in New York City than any other city outside of Asia. And more Jewish people live there than any other city outside of Israel.</li>\n<li>25% of the world&rsquo;s gold bullion is stored in vaults under Wall Street (the Federal Reserve Bank)</li>\n<li>1 out of every 21 New Yorker is a millionaire</li>\n<li>With over 800 languages spoken by a significant portion of the population, New York City is the most linguistically diverse city in the world.</li>\n<li>The Empire State Building has its own zip code.</li>\n<li>Einstein&rsquo;s eyeballs are locked in a safe deposit box somewhere in the city.</li>\n<li>The city gets about 15 times more snow than the South Pole every year (because Antarctica is a desert and therefore receives very little precipitation).</li>\n<li>New York&rsquo;s Central Park is larger than the principality of Monaco.</li>\n<li>Annual location shots on the streets on New York number 40,000 &ndash; including commercials, feature films, television shows and series, music videos and documentaries.</li>\n<li>The Manhattan grid pattern produces an effect known as &ldquo;Manhattanhenge&rdquo; (like Stonehenge) as, on two days &ndash; around 28<sup>th</sup> May and around 12<sup>th</sup> July &ndash; sunset is directly aligned with the street grid pattern.

Weather</strong></p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;">New York City features a humid subtropical climate. The city weather can vary from day to day, and even hour to hour, but a guide to the seasons can help you plan your wardrobe. More generally, spring in New York City brings budding flowers, light winds and rain, with the season&rsquo;s temperature ranging from chilly to warm. Winter are cold and damp, and prevailing wind patterns that blow offshore minimize the moderating effects of the Atlantic Ocean; yet the Atlantic and the partial shielding from colder air by the Appalachians keep the city warmer in the winder than inland North American cities. January is the coldest month with temperature ranging from 32.6 ᵒF (0.3 ᵒC) to 10 ᵒF (-12 ᵒC). Summers are typically warm to hot and humid, with a daily mean temperature of 76.5 ᵒF (24.7 ᵒC) to 90 &ndash; 100 ᵒF (32 &ndash; 38 ᵒC) in July.</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>6. Transportation</strong></p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;">New York is an excellent walking city, and getting around by foot is the best way to familiarise yourself with neighbourhoods and their divisions. Of course, sometimes you&rsquo;ll need to move more quickly or cover great distances, for which you&rsquo;ve got subways, buses and taxis at your disposal</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><u>Subways</u>:</strong> subway trains operate 24 hours a day, seven days a week. For $2.75 (the cost of a single ride when using a pay-per-ride MetroCard), you can use the system citywide and transfer to other subway lines as many times as you need, as long as you don&rsquo;t exit the system through a turnstile. You can also transfer from bus to subway or vice versa within two hours of using your MetroCard. The subway however does not travel to Staten Island. To get there, board the free Staten Island Ferry or take a bus.<br /><img src="/images/f.jpg" /></li>\n<li><strong><u>The Roosevelt Island Tram</u>:</strong> with the swipe of a MetroCard, the Roosevelt Island Tram gives you an aerial view of Midtown East along its path from 59<sup>th</sup> Street and Second Avenue in Manhattan to Roosevelt Island, located in the East River between Manhattan and Queens. The Tram got its start in the early 1900s, taking passengers halfway across the Queensboro Ridge, where an elevator would then transport them down the island.</li>\n<li><strong><u>Bike</u>:</strong> plenty of operations rent bikes by the half day and full day, with many such places located near the major biking destinations.</li>\n<li><strong><u>Ferry</u>:</strong>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>The Staten Island Ferry</strong> takes you on the route between Staten Island and Manhattan&rsquo;s Whitehall Ferry Terminal where you can enjoy the great views of the Statue of Liberty, New York Harbour and Lower Manhattan on the 25 minutes&rsquo; free mini cruise.</li>\n<li><strong>New York Water Taxi:</strong> another popular aquatic shuttle that takes you to Pier 84 (at 44<sup>th</sup> Street), Christopher Street, the World Financial Centre and Pier 1 in DUMBO.</li>\n<li><strong>NY Waterway:</strong> operates commuter ferries between points in Manhattan and New Jersey, and harbour and sightseeing cruises. The East River Ferry also provides a refreshing alternative to more traditional public transportation in the City with regular service to seven locations across the three boroughs.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong><u>Taxi</u>:</strong> yellow taxicabs and green Boro Taxis is regulated by the Taxi and Limousine Commission. Hotel doormen can hail a cab for you; a $1 tip is customary for this service. Tip 15-20% at the end of a trip; tolls are extra and added to the metered fare.</li>\n<li><strong><u>Helicopter</u>:</strong> seeing New York by air is an unforgettable experience. <em>Liberty Helicopters</em> (800-542-9933) runs several tours of the City; <em>Helicopter Flight Services, Inc</em>. (212-355-0801) will personalise sightseeing tours and charters; and <em>New York Helicopter Charter, Inc.</em> (212-361-606) allows you to choose from three options: the Liberty Tour, the Central Park Tour, and the Grand Tour, which combines the first two tours and also flies over many other essential NYC attractions.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Reference:</p>\n<p><a href="http://www.nycgo.com">http://www.nycgo.com</a></p>	Brooklyn-Bridge.jpg	\N	\N	on	1	2017-02-13 00:22:51.243988+00	2017-02-13 00:22:51.243988+00	38	1
79	General Information		\N	<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>1. Introduction</strong></p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;">San Francisco have taken many visitors&rsquo; hearts with its rich culture and fabled nightlife. While the city may not be the nation&rsquo;s biggest city, it certainly is one of its most cosmopolitan. The iconic Golden Gate Bridge, hilly landscape, year-round fog, cable cars and colourful Victorian houses are all what make San Francisco so wonderfully interesting.</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>2. History of Foundation</strong></p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The earliest evidence of human habitation of the territory of the city of San Francisco dates to 3000BC, that&rsquo;s right, about 10,000 years ago. Even before the Pacific waters had breached the span now covered by the Golden Gate Bridge, the Yelamu group of the Ohlone people resided in a few small villages. The city remained untouched by Europeans until 1579 when Sir Francis Drake, the decorated English lotter of Spanish galleons sailed past the entrance of the San Francisco Bay, dubbed a stretch of Marin &ldquo;Nova Albion&rdquo; and sailed away.</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;">In 1821, Mexico won its independence from Spain, cementing the decline of the mission era. In 1835 an American, William Richardson, became the first permanent resident of Yerba Buena. By the 1840s, dozens more Americans came to Alta California and began agitating for independence. After a briefly declared &ldquo;California Republic&rdquo;, they welcomed the arrival of James B. Montgomery, a U.S Navy captain who came ashore on 9<sup>th</sup> July 1846, to raise the U.S flag in Yerba Buena&rsquo;s plaza (Portsmouth Square today).</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;">On 24<sup>th</sup> January 1848, the first gold was found at Sutter&rsquo;s Fort, in the California foothills. Within months, san Francisco became the central port and depot of the frenzied Gold Rush. Over the next year, arriving &ldquo;forty-niners&rdquo; increased the city&rsquo;s population from 1,000 to 25,000.</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;">On 18<sup>th</sup> April 1906, the San Andreas Fault slipped more than 10 feet, unleashing a massive earthquake later estimated at 7.8 on the Richter scale. The tremors broke water mains and triggered fires that raged for four days, killing 3,000 people, destroying 25,000 buildings and leaving 250,000 homeless. The city rebuilt quickly with an improved city centre and hosted the lavish Panama International Exposition just nine years later. The 1930s saw growth both in the city and its outlying communities, and the construction of the iconic Golden Gate and San Francisco Bay Bridges.</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;">San Francisco was the main point of embarkation for World War II&rsquo;s Pacific theatre, and the region became a major arms production centre. After Pearl Harbor, the city&rsquo;s Japanese residents were forced into internment camps far island. Their abandoned neighbourhood was soon filled by African-Americans arriving from the South to work in the war industries. The city also played a key role in the transition from World War II to the Cold War, hosting the 1954 conference at which the UN Charter was drafted and continuing to draw workers to develop technologies for the nuclear age.</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;">San Francisco has maintained its reputation as a centre of cultural bohemianism. In earlier it had drawn writers from Mark Twain to Jack London, and it became a centre for the 1950s beat poets and for the Haight-Ashbury hippie counterculture that peaked with the 1967 &ldquo;Summer of Love&rdquo;. On 17<sup>th</sup> October 1989, another large earthquake hit the city, damaging buildings, collapsing freeways and killing 67 people. A decade later, a boom cantered on Internet Technology began, drawing entrepreneurs to the city and raising rents, respectability and resentment in its rougher neighbourhoods. The crowded city&rsquo;s population, steady for decades, began to rise again.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>3. Area &amp; population</strong></p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;">San Francisco is located on the West Coast of the United States at the north end of the San Francisco Peninsula and includes significant stretches of the Pacific Ocean and San Francisco Bay within its boundaries. Several picturesque islands &ndash; Alcatraz, Treasure Island and the adjacent Yerba Buena Island, and small portions of Alameda Island, Red Rock Island, and Angel Island &ndash; are part of the city.</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The neighbourhood of San Francisco are as diverse as they are fascinating. Whether moving to the Golden Gate City or just trying to get to know its most unique area, below are the neighbourhood guide to the basics of each neighbourhood, outlining the main attractions and some of the more notable hotspot unique to each.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Castro District:</strong> the area historically known as Eureka Valley where working-class Scandinavian and Irish used to reside. Now the universally agreed Mecca of gay life is San Francisco&rsquo;s Castro District. The affluent North side of Market is home to a predominantly gay and lesbian community, excellent bakeries, boutiques, cafes, restaurants, and of course, gender bending bars. The famed Castro Theatre, the Castro&rsquo;s historic art deco movie palace, screen old and independent films from around the world. On Halloween, the centre of San Francisco is the Castro, with crowds in the thousands celebrating on the streets.</li>\n<li><strong>The South Market:</strong> was once San Francisco&rsquo;s industrial core, has been through significant development and is home to new skyscrapers, live-work lofts, and condominiums.</li>\n<li><strong>Fisherman&rsquo;s Wharf:</strong> popular with tourists and sea lions, the area is full of shops, silly museums and family fun. Still a working wharf, its vendors sell thousands of tons of fish and shellfish. Take an early morning to walk down &ldquo;Fish Alley&rdquo; to see fisherman at work. Later, the Wharf is boardwalk-style family entertainment with decidedly attractions such as Ripley&rsquo;s Believe It or Not! Museum, the Red &amp; White Fleet, the Wax Museum, and the Aquarium. For maritime-lovers and WWII buffs, the San Francisco Maritime Museum is at the foot of Polk St and massive USS Pampanito is docked right at pier 45.</li>\n<li><strong>Financial District:</strong> named for its abundance of modern and historic buildings that house headquarters of corporations like Charles Schwab, Gap Inc., VISA, the 12<sup>th</sup> district of the Federal Reserve and more. Shopping malls like Embarcadero Center, the Ferry Building and Crocker Galleria frequently welcome spree-loving locals and leisure travellers. By virtue of all the businesses in the area, there are also plenty of snazzy little bars where many of the corporate bigwigs have been known to enjoy a martini lunch.</li>\n<li><strong>Mission District:</strong> reputation for hipsters, Latinos, cheap food and drink. The heart of San Francisco&rsquo;s predominantly Latino neighbourhood is 24<sup>th</sup> Street, a colourful collection of authentic restaurants, tanquerias, Mexican bakeries, produce markets, specialty shops and murals. Mission Dolores at 16<sup>th</sup> and Dolores street is the oldest structure in San Francisco (many of San Fran&rsquo;s Spanish pioneers are buried on the site) and, two blocks away, on Dolores and 18<sup>th</sup>, the palm tree studded Dolores Park (O&rsquo;Dolores Beach to sunbathers) still has a Spanish flavour.</li>\n<li><strong>North Beach:</strong> San Francisco&rsquo;s version of the Red Light District, North Beach at night is a bustling neon home to strip joints, bars, cafes and restaurants. Meander through the streets off Broadway and see how it&rsquo;s called San Francisco&rsquo;s &ldquo;Little Italy&rdquo;. Like its Italian heritage, this San Fran neighbourhood still holds onto its 1950s Beatnik legacy with the bohemian City Lights Bookstore at the corner of Columbus Ave and Jack Kerouac Alley. Don&rsquo;t miss Tai Chi nearby Washington Square on weekdays or the North Beach Jazz Festival every August.</li>\n<li><strong>Chinatown:</strong> reputation for exotic, crowded open markets and being the oldest neighbourhood in San Francisco. Enter at &ldquo;Dragon&rsquo;s Gate&rdquo; at Grant Ave and Bush Street. This neighbourhood is packed with Chinese restaurants, shops, temples and street vendors; great for exotic gifts, and fireworks on Lunar New Year.</li>\n<li><strong>SOMA:</strong> San Francisco&rsquo;s sprawling South of Market District (SOMA) is home to web gurus, urban warriors, offbeat artists, and an unending supply of club kids. This neighbourhood&rsquo;s industrial, warehouse nature is perfect for the mega clubs and leatherman alike. Dance-hungry hipsters flock to bars like 1015 Folsom and the infamous End Up while risqu&eacute; gay bars like the Eagle, the Stud and the Hole In the Wall draw a more community more diverse than then queens of the Castro. In the daylight hours, look for substantial San Francisco discount shopping, like cheap fabrics, designer labels and furniture.</li>\n<li><strong>Union Square:</strong> A lone Corinthian column surrounded by newly installed palm tree marks San Fran&rsquo;s mecca for shopaholics. Ringed by Macy&rsquo;s, Saks, Neiman Marcus and Levi&rsquo;s stores along with colourful flower stands and street performers. Surrounding street feature superstores like Virgin Megastore, FAO Schwarz, Gump&rsquo;s and Britex Fabrics along with boutiques for Coach, Bulgari, Cartier, Thomas Pink, Louis Vuitton, MaxMara, Emporio Armani, Diesel, Prada, Celine, Escada, Gucci, Guess, Hermes, Agnes B., Bestsey Johnson and Wilkes Bashford.</li>\n</ul>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The U.S Census 2015 reported that San Francisco had a population of 805,235. With a population density of 12,160 per square mile, San Francisco is the second-most densely populated major American city behind only New York. The city&rsquo;s demographic is 48.5% non-Hispanic white, 33.3% Asian, Hispanic and Latino makes up 15% of the population, 6% Black or African American, and the below 1% rest is of other races (American Indian, Native Hawaiian Pacific Islander).</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>4.

Weather</strong></p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;">San Francisco&rsquo;s climate is characteristic of the cool-summer Mediterranean climate of California&rsquo;s coast, with moist wild winter and dry summers. San Francisco&rsquo;s weather is strongly influenced by the cool currents of the Pacific Ocean on the west side of the city, and the water of San Francisco Bay to the north and east. Among U.S cities, San Fran has the coolest daily mean, maximum, and minimum temperature for June, July and August. During the Summer, rising hot air in California&rsquo;s interior valleys creates a low pressure area that draws winds from the North Pacific High through the Golden Gate, which creates the city&rsquo;s characteristic cools winds and fog. The fog is less pronounced in eastern neighbourhoods and during the late summer and early fall, which is the warmest time of the year.</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The dry period of May to October is mild to warm, with the normal monthly mean temperature peaking in September at 62.7 &deg;F (17.1 &deg;C). The rainy period of November to April is slightly cooler, with the normal monthly mean temperature reaching its lowest in January at 51.3 &deg;F (10.7 &deg;C). Snowfall in the city is very rare, with only 10 measurable accumulations recorded since 1852, most recently in 1976 when up to 5 inches (13cm) fell on Twin Peaks.</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>6. Transportation</strong></p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Due to its unique geography, and the freeway revolts of the late 1950s, San Francisco is one of the few American cities with arterial thoroughfares instead of having numerous highways within the city.</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Interstate 80 begins at the approach to the Bay Bridge and is the only direct automobile link to the East Bay U.S Route 101 connects to the western terminus of Interstate 80 and provides access to the south of the city along San Francisco Bay toward Silicon Valley. Northward, the routing for U.S 101 uses arterial streets to connect to the Golden Gate Bridge, the only direct automobile link to Marin County and the North Bay.</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;">State Route 1 also enters San Francisco from the north via the Golden Gate Bridge and bisects the city as the 19<sup>th</sup> Avenue arterial thoroughfare, joining with the Interstate 280 at the city&rsquo;s southern border.</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;">State Route 35 enters the city from the south as Skyline Boulevard and terminates at its intersection with Highway 1. State Route 82 enters San Francisco from the south as Mission Street, and terminates shortly thereafter at its junction with 280.</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;">32% of San Francisco residents use public transportation in daily commuting to work ranking it first on the West Coast and third overall in the United States.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>The San Francisco Municipal Railway (known as Muni)</strong> is the primary public transit system of San Francisco. Muni is the seventh-largest transit system in the United States. The system operates both a combined light rail and subway system, the Muni Metro, and a large bus network. Additionally, it runs a historic streetcar line, which designated as a National Historic Landmark to Fisherman&rsquo;s Wharf. It also operates the famous cable cars, which have been designated as a National Historic Landmark and are a major tourist attraction.<br /><img src="/images/h.png" width="588" height="523" /></li>\n<li><strong>BART:</strong> a regional Rapid Transit system, connects San Francisco with the East Bay through the underwater Transbay Tube. The line runs under Market Street to Civic Center where it turns south to the Mission District, the southern part of the city, and through northern San Mateo County, to the San Francisco International Airport, and Millbrae. Another Commuter Rail system, Caltrain, runs from San Francisco along the San Francisco Peninsula to San Jose. Historically, trains operated by Southern Pacific Lines ran from San Francisco to Los Angeles, via Palo Alto and San Jose.<br /><img src="/images/i.png" /></li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>AMTRAK California Thruway Motorcoach</strong> runs a shuttle bus from San Francisco to its rail station across the Bay in Emeryville. Lines from Emeryville include the Capitol Corridor, San Joaquin, California Zephyr, and Coast Starlight. Thruway service also runs south to San Luis Obispo, California with connection to the Pacific Surfiner.<br /><img src="/images/j.jpg" /></li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>San Francisco Bay Ferry</strong> operates from the Ferry Building and Pier 39 to points in Oakland, Alameda, Bay Farm Island, South San Francisco, and north to Vallejo in Solano County. The Golden Gate Ferry is the other ferry operator with service between San Francisco and Marin County. Soltrans runs supplement bus service between the Ferry Building and Vallejo.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Reference:</p>\n<p><a href="http://www.sftravel.com">http://www.sftravel.com</a></p>\n<p><a href="http://www.sanfrancisco.com">http://www.sanfrancisco.com</a></p>	Alcatraz Island.jpg	\N	\N	on	1	2017-02-13 00:30:03.8714+00	2017-02-13 00:30:03.8714+00	39	1

The rollicking corner space is convenient to the Brooklyn Botanic Garden and the Franklin Avenue subway top. At happy hours, certain drinks and desserts are discounted, but it&rsquo;s a happy scene here pretty much all the time.

The restaurant is named for the tidal straight between Brooklyn and Governors Island, said to be so strong it could churn milk into butter.</li>\n<li><strong>Maison Premier:</strong> this oyster house with a spirited atmosphere, bivalves and absinthe in copious quantities is a one famous restaurant in town. The interior of Maison Premier is nothing short of lovely; a modern homage to Parisian and New Orleans oyster bars of yesteryear. The emphasis here is on old-world elegance, from the grand marble horseshoe bar at the heart of the space to the carefully considered details throughout. There is also a worth-noting menu, which boasts 30 different oyster varieties, top-notch cocktails and the &ldquo;largest premium absinthe collection in New York City&rdquo;. Happy hour, from 4-7pm on weekdays and 11am-1pm on weekends, is particularly busy, thanks to oysters priced at just $1 each.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Queens Dining:</strong>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Casa Enrique:</strong> for its impressive posole, mole and chile relleno, Casa Enrique captured a star in Michelin&rsquo;s 2015 guide. The Long Island City restaurant was singled out for its &ldquo;haute take on Mexican cuisine&rdquo; that&rsquo;s a &ldquo;welcome blend of creativity and tradition. The &ldquo;haute&rdquo; part comes courtesy of Cosme Aguilar, a French-trained chef from Mexico&rsquo;s southernmost state of Chiapas. He and his brother Luis opened this sleed, contemporary hot spot in 2012 and got noticed almost immediately for superior tacos cradling slowly cooked brisket and complex, labor-intensive mole sauce saturating tender chicken breast. Kick things off with some fine tequila and chunky, jalapeno-laced guacamole, and finish with luscious, caramel-topped tres leche cake.</li>\n<li><strong>Danny Brown Wine Bar &amp; Kitchen:</strong> For four years, Forest Hill&rsquo;s Danny Brown Wine Bar &amp; Kitchen was the only Queens restaurant with a Michelin star. In 2015, the standby took home the honour for a fifth straight year, this time joined by three other borough eateries. The intimate, convivial enoteca isappointed with modern art and has a stylish European vibe. Chef and co-owner Danny Brown trained in kitchens in Spain, France and Italy, and there&rsquo;s an element of each nation&rsquo;s cuisine in his own. Balanced, perfectly executed dishes include Serrano ham croquettes, bacon-wrapped terrine of rabbit with red-wine-poached prunes, and mighty sweet pea ravioli with black olive crumble and light ricotta. Wines on the list span the globe.</li>\n<li><strong>Dumpling Galaxy:</strong> Flushing is bursting with great Asian spots, and the one everyone&rsquo;s heading to these days is Dumpling Galaxy. Inside the Arcadia Mall, a few blocks from the last stop on the 7 train in Queens, is a modern, red-accented restaurant featuring a veritable star system of dumplings. Lamb and chives, duck and shiitakes, beed and carrots, asparagus and egg- these only begin the tell the story. Steamed or panfried, they&rsquo;re overstuffed, artful sealed and very tasty. Other specialties over the years include scallion pancakes, steamed whole fish and sweet and sour pork.</li>\n<li><strong>Mapo Korean B.B.Q:</strong> Queen&rsquo;s Murray Hill, whose name comes from the same family as the Murray Hill in Manhattan, hosts a thriving Korean population and feels like a village on the outskirts of Seoul. Mapo Korean B.B.Q is among the neighbourhood&rsquo;s best steakhouses, although it&rsquo;s so unadorned it looks more like a barbecue joint. Prime meats are marinated and cooked over charcoals embedded in the centre of each table, the duty handled by assiduous waitresses who control the flames and flip and snip bites small enough to be wrapped in lettuce leaves. Kalbi-beef shirt ribs-are the most essential dish here, and their price includes a whirlwind of accompaniments like tofu soup, spicy kimchi, marinated vegetables, creamed corn, smashed potatoes, potato salad and steamed, custard-like eggs.</li>\n<li><strong>Salt &amp; Fat:</strong> the tasty of two components liberally applied, in various guises (frequently bacon or ham, sometimes spicy mayo or a duck fat crouton), to the like of grilled asparagus, Prince Edward Island mussels&rsquo; broth, arctic char and the occasional dessert are all served in thie Sunnyside restaurant in Queens. Chef and owner Daniel Yi frequently alters his globally influenced New American menu and keeps portions small, tapas style, so course are rich but not heavy. Three to four dishes are enough for two to share. The comfortable, candlelit space offers attentive service, compliment bacon-fat popcorn to start and free yoghurt drinks at the end.</li>\n<li><strong>Taverna Kyclades:</strong> Astoria has grown more multicultural in recent years but retains a strong Greek contingent. It also continues to attracts multitudes of Greek food lovers, judging from the lines out the door at Taverna Kyclades. Even on weekdays, people wait for sidewalk tables-especially when it&rsquo;s sunny. The boisterous, Mediterranean-themed dining room is appointed with a trophy swordfish, signifying that seafood is a strong point. Charred, meaty octopus, lightly battered calamari and whole sea bass all taste freshly caught. Pan-fried cheese, giant salads and assorted dips of skordalia, tzatziki and taramosalata spread on pita are also wonderful. The staff adds to the good cheer by handing out complimentary wine id the wait is long-and carafes are such a good deal there&rsquo;s no reason to not keep it flowing.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Bronx Dining:</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>South Bronx = Soul Food</li>\n<li>Arthur Avenue = Italian Provisions</li>\n<li>City Island = Fresh Seafood</li>\n<li>The rest of Bronx = Cuisine of the World.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Reference:</p>\n<p><a href="http://www.nycgo.com">http://www.nycgo.com</a></p>	Chrysler-Building2.jpg	\N	\N	on	1	2017-02-13 00:25:37.01091+00	2017-02-13 00:25:37.01091+00	38	3

With a history of exhibiting the most promising and influential artists and provoking intense debate, the Whitney Biennial, the museum&rsquo;s signature exhibition, has become the most important survey of the state of contemporary art in the United States.</li>\n<li><strong><u>Rockefeller Centre:</u></strong> A visit to New York City wouldn&rsquo;t be complete without a trip to Rockefeller Plaza, where skaters glide across the rink and thousands of lights gleam from the always-enormous Christmas tree in the winter, and outdoor dining options abound in the warmer months. No matter the season, come for the shops (from the FDNY Fire Zone store and museum to Swarovski), the eats (from Dean &amp; DeLuca to Mendy&rsquo;s Kosher Deli) and the stargazing here in NBC Studios&rsquo; backyard. The three observation decks at Top of the Rock showcase the City&rsquo;s spectacular skyline.</li>\n<li><strong><u>Patrick&rsquo;s Cathedral:</u></strong> holds its own among Midtown&rsquo;s tall building and historic architecture, its twin spires jutting 330 feet up toward the heavens. Fresh off a $177 million restoration-which cleaned those spires as well as the heavy bronze doors, ceiling, stained glass and enormous pipe organ-the Neo-Gothic church is among NYC&rsquo;s most-visited religious sites; in fact, it&rsquo;s among the City&rsquo;s most-visited attractions period, welcoming an estimated 5 million people every year. On 24<sup>th</sup> September a very special guest will be among those annual arrivals: Pope Francis will preside over a private vespers prayer service, becoming the fourth pontiff to visit the cathedral. Spanning the length of an entire City block, the building itself is made of brick but entirely overlaid in marble. There&rsquo;s much to see once you pass through the bronze doors and stand under the vaulted ceiling, including a giant organ with 7,855 pipes, a becy of stained-glass windows, more than 20 altars-two of which were designed by Tiffany &amp; Co. &ndash; and a marble Stations of the Cross, which won recognition at the 1893 World&rsquo;s Fair in Chicago.</li>\n<li><strong><u>The Statue of Liberty:</u></strong> was a gift from France to the United States as a token of goodwill for America&rsquo;s centennial of independence (and to send a message to France&rsquo;s oppressive Second Empire). Historian Edouard de Laboulaye first proposed the idea in 1865, shortly after the Union won the American Civil War. He then teamed up with French sculptor Frederic Auguste Bartholdi, an admirer of the US, democracy and colossal monuments. When design Liberty Enlightening the World (the statue&rsquo;s official name), the duo were careful not to make Liberty appear to be &ldquo;leading an uprising&rdquo; but rather &ldquo;lighting the way, peacefully and lawfully&rdquo;, according to park service literature. They started construction in Paris in 1875 and shipped the completed pieces 10 years later, in 1885. On 28<sup>th</sup> October 1886, a million New Yorkers cheered the official dedication. Since then, the statue has been a symbol of freedom, justice and opportunity for those who come to New York City and America.</li>\n<li><strong><u>Yankee Stadium</u>:</strong> the home of the New York Yankees is one of the City&rsquo;s most beloved sports sites. The team&rsquo;s current address preserves many of the design details that defined the original place- The House That Ruth Built-where the baseball team played from 1923 until the new version opened for the 2009 season. The outfield stands still feature the Bleacher Creatures (very loud, very dedicated fans), but now there are fancy suites, a wider variety of concessions and a state-of-the-art video board. The stadium is also home to the New York City Football Club (soccer) and sometimes hosts other big events like concerts.</li>\n<li><strong><u>Madison Square Garden:</u></strong> The Garden is the city&rsquo;s premiere sports and entertainment complex, home to the New York Rangers, Knicks and Liberty teams, as well as the stage for massively popular artists like Tina Turner, AC/DC and Oasis. The more intimate Theatre at Madison Square Garden also hosts concerts and shows, such as Wintuk from Cirque de Soleil, and stand-up comedians like Chris Rock and Kathy Griffin.</li>\n<li><strong><u>Barclays Centre:</u></strong> Major-league sports at the corner of Atlantic and Flatbush Avenues have been a long time coming-since the 1950s, in fact-but the 18,2000-seat Barclays Centre is now a reality. Home to the Brooklyn Nets, the arena also features the more intimate 7,700-seat Tidal theatre, the Shops at Barclays Centre (including the Nets Lifestyle Shop by Adidas), and more than 50 local food vendors. In addition to the Nets, the Barclays Centre hosts college and prep basketball, boxing, hockey, circuses, family shows, and concerts ranging from Arcade Fire to Jay Z to Yanni.</li>\n<li><strong><u>Citi Field:</u></strong> The 42,000-seat venue echoes the design of Ebbets Field while also paying tribute to the baseball team&rsquo;s Polo Grounds and Shea Stadium heritage, which dates back to 1962. The Mets Hall of Fame and Museum, next to Jackie Robinson Rotunda, celebrates the organisation&rsquo;s history. From time to time, the stadium hosts major concerts-by the likes of Beyonc&eacute; and Foo Fighter-and other large non-baseball events.</li>\n<li><strong><u>Flushing Meadows Corona Park:</u> </strong>The largest park in Queens (and fourth largest park in all of New York City) has something for jocks, artists, nature lovers and the technologically inclined: green recreational spaces for baseball, soccer and cricket; playgrounds; skateboarding areas; handball courts; dog runs; the Queen Museum; the New York Hall of Science; the Queens Zoo, USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Centre (home of the US Open); and Citi Field, home to the Mets. Also the Unispehere, a symbol of diversity constructed for the 1964-1965 World&rsquo;s Fair, sit at the centre of Queen&rsquo;s primary green space.</li>\n<li><strong><u>Bronx Zoo:</u></strong> The Bronx Zoo of the Wildlife Conservation Society is the premier place to study and appreciate the world&rsquo;s many creatures. Home to more than 6,000 animals, the zoo spans 265 acres that re-create the diverse natural habitats of its numerous residents. You&rsquo;ll find the lemurs of Madagascar, gorillas of the Congo and snow leopards of the Himalayas, along with the denizens that stalk Tiger Mountain. Sea lion and penguin feedings are always visitors favourite.</li>\n<li><strong><u>Brooklyn Bridge:</u></strong> the bridge was designed by John A. Roebling, an immigrant from Prussia, though he died due to complications from a freak accident in 1869, just before construction commenced. His son Washington took over supervision, but a case of the bends sidelined him. Washington Roebling&rsquo;s wide, Emily, ultimately oversaw the balance of construction, which was completed in 1883; the bridge&rsquo;s dedication and opening took place in 24<sup>th</sup> May 1883. The bridge has been celebrated in song, glamourized on celluloid and immortalized in poetry, the postcard-perfect Brooklyn Bridge stands as one of New York City&rsquo;s most recognisable symbols &ndash; not to mention a magnificent feat of engineering. Upon its completion in 1883, it became the first roadway to connect Manhattan and Brooklyn. Back then, the Brooklyn Bridge was also the world&rsquo;s longest suspension bridge &ndash; its 1595-foot central span unsurpassed until the Williamsburg Bridge&rsquo;s completion two decades later. The bridge&rsquo;s appearance sets it apart: its Gothic towers with double arches, criss-crossing steel cables and graceful, gentle curvature make walking or biking across the span a sough-after experience for visitors.</li>\n<li><strong><u>The Staten Island Ferry:</u></strong> not only the way most New Yorkers and visitors travel between Manhattan and Staten Island, it is also an attraction unto itself. According to the Encyclopaedia of New York City, boat service between Staten Island and Manhattan dates back to 1731; it was a century later when steam-powered ferries began running the route. The City took over the ships in 1905, and they&rsquo;ve remained an important part of the New York transit system, as well as a major tourist attraction since then. Before bridges linked NYC&rsquo;s islands (Staten Island, Manhattan and Long Island &ndash; on which Brooklyn and Queens sit), boats were the way people travelled from one to another. Of the ferry services that still exist, the Staten Island Ferry serves by far the greatest number of passengers.</li>\n<li><strong><u>The 9/11 Memorial &amp; Museum:</u></strong> designed by architect Michael Arad in collaboration with landscape architect Peter Walker. Arad, who witnessed the second plane hitting the World Trade Centre&rsquo;s south tower, designed the 9/11 Memorial Museum to tells the story of the events of 9/11 through artefacts that range in scale from the monumental to the intimate, as well as through first-person accounts and multimedia displays. The 9/11 Memorial consists of two enormous reflecting pools set in the footprints of the Twin Towers. Each pool is about an acre in size, 30-foot waterfalls cascade down all sides. Hundreds of white oak trees line the surrounding plaza. Advance purchase of museum admission is strongly recommended. The 9/11 is open daily.</li>\n<li><strong><u>Prospect Park:</u></strong> constructed between 1865 and 1895 by Central Park designers Frederick Law Olmsted and Calvert Vaux, Prospect Park is one of NY&rsquo;s most beautiful and intriguing public spaces. With a size of 585-acre, the park is sandwiched between five Brooklyn neighbourhoods &ndash; Park Slope, Prospect Heights, Prospect Lefferts Gardens, Prospect Park South and Windsor Terrace. Prospect Park is known for its luxuriously vast green spaces, including wetlands, forest areas and a great number of trees. Some of its more popular attractions include the bandshell, Audubon Centre, the zoo and Grand Army Plaza, to name a few.</li>\n<li><strong><u>Coney Island</u>:</strong> Coney Island &ndash; New York City&rsquo;s legendary amusement district &ndash; is not a theme park. The home of the Cyclone roller coaster, the Wonder Wheel, the original Nathan&rsquo;s Famous hot dogs and the Boardwalk is something different: a seaside playground that&rsquo;s also a real-life NYC neighbourhood. Its many attractions have made it a warm-weather favourite for all, featuring see-it-to-believe-it sideshows, beachfront stands selling funnel cake, one of the City&rsquo;s oldest and best pizzerias and the Brooklyn Cyclones baseball team. On a bright summer day, no place feels more electric.</li>\n<li><strong><u>Lincoln Centre for the Performing Arts</u>:</strong> Lincoln Centre is one of the cornerstones of New York City&rsquo;s culture, consisting of a campus of 11 organisations focused on music, dance and theatre. The David H. Koch Theatre, Metropolitan Opera House and David Geffen Hall provide stages for the New York City Ballet, Met Opera and New York Philharmonic &ndash; three of the 11 arts organisation in residence at Lincoln Centre.</li>\n<li><strong><u>The High Line:</u></strong> one of the City&rsquo;s most popular and distinctive parks. Built on a once-abandoned elevated rail line, the green space offers unparalleled views of Manhattan&rsquo;s far west side. With places to sit and people-watch, patches of grass, seasonal blooms and fascinating architectural feature throughout, it&rsquo;s a great place to relax, and makes for an envy-inducing photo backdrop.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Reference:</p>\n<p><a href="http://www.nycgo.com">http://www.nycgo.com</a></p>	Central Park.jpg	\N	\N	on	1	2017-02-13 00:24:55.941392+00	2017-02-13 00:24:55.941392+00	38	2
80	Attractions		\N	<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>1. PIER 39:</strong> located in San Francisco&rsquo;s Fisherman&rsquo;s Wharf, at Beach Street and The Embarcadero. It is the most visited destination in San Francisco - offers two levels of dining, entertainment, shopping and attractions, all surrounded by unbeatable views of the city and the bay. Located along the Historic San Francisco waterfront, PIER 39&rsquo;s location provides the picture perfect backdrop for postcard views of the Golden Gate Bridge, Alcatraz, Angel Island and the famous city skyline.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Visit the <strong>Sea Lions</strong>: a crowd of boisterous sea lions who camp out on PIER 39&rsquo;s K-Dock have been resided there since 1990, arriving in droves shortly after the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake (scientists still aren&rsquo;t exactly sure why). PIER 39&rsquo;s Sea Lion Webcam allows you to virtually visit them at your leisure.</li>\n<li>Journey under the <strong>Golden Gate Bridge</strong>: The Golden Gate Bridge is a sight unlike any other, and a must-see for any visitor to San Francisco. Although the most breathtaking angle is one you can only experience by stepping off land and cruising the Bay&rsquo;s sparkling waters. Blue &amp; Gold Fleets&rsquo; Bay Cruise takes you directly underneath the bridge on a smooth, one-hour journey that provides some of San Francisco&rsquo;s most stunning photo-ops of Alcatraz, the city skyline, the Bay Lights and more.

Golden Gate Bridge</strong></p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Once called &ldquo;the bridge that couldn&rsquo;t be built&rdquo;, today it is one of the seven wonders of the modern world. This magnificent span, perhaps San Francisco&rsquo;s most famous landmark, opened in 1937 after a four-year struggle against relentless winds, fog, rock and treacherous tides. The bridge was built at a cost of $35 million in principal and $39 million in interest and 11 worker&rsquo;s lives. The single-suspension span is anchored by twin towers that reach skyward 746 feet, and was once taller than any building in San Francisco. To support the suspended roadway, two cables, each more than 7,000 feet in length and both containing 80,000 miles of wire stretch over the top of the towers and are rooted in concrete anchorages on shore. More than 10 years in planning due to formidable opposition, but only four years in actual construction, the Golden Gate Bridge brought the communities of San Francisco and Marin counties closer together. Some fun facts about the Golden Gate Bridge:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The Golden Gate Bridge has lost 7,500 tons (in weight) since it opened in 1937</li>\n<li>It is estimated that 5,000 &ndash; 10,000 gallons of paint are used to repaint the Golden Gate Bridge each year.</li>\n<li>Three babies have been born on the Golden Gate Bridge. All of them have been boys.</li>\n<li>The name came from the fact that the Golden Gate Strait (named by John Fremont) is the entrance into San Francisco Bay form the Pacific Ocean.</li>\n<li>International Orange was selected as the colour of the bridge because it provided visibility in the fog for passing ships and also because it was a colour that fit in naturally to the bridge&rsquo;s setting and the surrounding land area.</li>\n<li>The bridge has only been closed three times due to weather since it was built; all three due to high winds gusting close to or over 70 miles per hour.</li>\n</ul>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>3. Golden Gate Park:</strong> One of the largest urban parks in the world, Golden Gate Park stretches for three miles on the western edge of San Francisco. There&rsquo;s not a single &ldquo;Keep Off the Grass&rdquo; sign and its 1,017 acres are a tonic for mind and body. Two major museums, splendid gardens and facilities for more than 20 sports confirm that this is a playground in every sense of the world.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>The de Young Museum</strong>: a top destination while visiting San Francisco, the de Young museum showcases an extraordinary permanent collection of American art from the 17<sup>th</sup> through 21<sup>st</sup> centuries, modern and contemporary art, photography, international textiles and costumes, and art from Africa, Oceania, and the Americas. The ninth-floor Observation Level of the de Young&rsquo;s Hamon Tower offers breathtaking 360-degree views of San Francisco and the Pacific Ocean. It closes most Monday and holidays, special exhibition tickets available for additional price.</li>\n<li><strong>California Academy of Sciences</strong>: explore an aquarium, planetarium and natural history museum all under one living roof. A four-story living rainforest and awe-inspiring coral reef ecosystem will delight visitors of all ages, while immersive planetarium shows will transport audience through space and time for a new perspective on our planet.

The museum is also available for special events of up to 3,000 guests.</li>\n<li><strong>Conservatory of Flowers</strong>: Historic San Francisco landmark in Golden Gate Park since 1879 boasting rare tropical flowers and plants from around the world. This gem of Victorian architecture has a long and storied history, and is the oldest public wood-and-glass conservatory in North America. Since re-opening in 2003, the Conservatory has garnered numerous local, state and national awards; as well as a place where horticultural societies, botany students, and young plant enthusiasts gather to study collections and ensure passions for living museums and conservatories will continue to flourish.</li>\n</ul>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>4. Lombard Street:</strong> known as the &ldquo;Crookedest Street in the World&rdquo;, Lombard Street is one of San Francisco&rsquo;s most popular landmark. Every year, hundreds of thousands of visitors walk or drive down its eight sharp hairpin turns. Surrounded by Russian Hill mansions and perfectly manicured landscaping and flowers, it is also one of the city&rsquo;s most scenic streets. Take a spectacular photo at the bottom of the curvy portion looking up or enjoy the breathtaking view from the top looking out onto the San Francisco Bay, the Bay Bridge and Coit Tower. Some fun facts:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Although it is known as the &ldquo;Crookedest Street in the World&rdquo;, Lombard Street is not even the &ldquo;crookedest&rdquo; street in San Francisco. That title technically belongs to Vermont Street between 20<sup>th</sup> and 22<sup>nd</sup> streets on Potrero Hill.</li>\n<li>It may look treacherous but Lombard Street&rsquo;s switchbacks were actually built to increase the safety of the street. The natural steep grade of Potrero Hill was thought to be too dangerous. In the 1920s, a property owner suggested a series of switchboards which not only add to the street&rsquo;s scenic appeal but made it safer for pedestrians.</li>\n<li>The name Lombard actually has no link to San Francisco history. It is named after a street in Philadelphia.</li>\n<li>A race every Easter Sunday where people race big-wheeled plastic bikes, started on Lombard Street before moving to Vermont Street on Potrero Hill, where it takes place now.</li>\n</ul>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>5. Alcatraz Island</strong>: Alcatraz was the site of the first lighthouse in the Western United States but became a federal penitentiary from 1934-1963, housing famous convicts such as Al Capone and George &ldquo;Machine Gun&rdquo; Kelly. Now this once infamous prison island is part of the Bay Area&rsquo;s 80,000-acre Golden Gate National Recreation Area. Located one-and-a-half miles from Fisherman&rsquo;s Wharf, Alcatraz is one of the city&rsquo;s most popular attractions. A visit to the island includes a tour of the cell house where visitors can see where the prisoners lived. Although the last inmates were transferred off the island in 1963, the main prison block with its steel bars, claustrophobic (9 x 5-foot) cells, messy hall, library and &ldquo;dark holes&rdquo;, where recalcitrant languished in inky blackness, is still structurally intact.</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>6. SFMOMA:</strong> Founded in 1935 as the first West Coast museum devoted to modern and contemporary art, a thoroughly transformed San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, with enhanced gallery, education, and public spaces, opened on May 14, 2016. The Sn&oslash;hetta-designed expansion, which incorporates the renovated Mario Botta building that opened in 1995, includes 170,000 square feet of new and renovated galleries tailored to the collection, enabling SFMOMA to display more of its outstanding holdings of more than 32,000 modern and contemporary artworks by Alexander Calder, Chuck Close, Frida Kahlo, Jackson Pollock, Gerhard Richter, Richard Serra, Cindy Sherman, and numerous others, along with post-war and contemporary artworks from the renowned Doris and Donald Fisher Collection and an entire floor dedicated solely to photography.

Don&rsquo;t miss the impressive new spaces dedicated to media art, which have been expanded and upgraded to the calibre a museum in such a tech-loving town deserves.</li>\n<li><strong>Sixth Floor</strong>: Here you&rsquo;ll find one of the best parts of the museum&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.sftravel.com/article/why-fisher-collection-matters">Fisher Collection</a>&ndash;its amazing post-war German masterpieces. Stroll through a jaw-dropping sequence of galleries devoted to Anselm Kiefer, Gerhard Richter, Georg Baselitz and Sigmar Polke. The museum is renowned for its holdings in this area.</li>\n<li><strong>Fifth Floor</strong>: Head straight to the exhibition of pop, minimal and figurative art (also from the Fisher Collection) and sample must-sees by Chuck Close, Roy Lichtenstein, Andy Warhol and Sol LeWitt. Stop for lunch at Caf&eacute; 5 if you feel hungry, choose the table in the rooftop sculpture garden.</li>\n<li><strong>Fourth Floor:</strong> Find your way to the glorious Ellsworth Kelly galleries. They span all stages of the artist&rsquo;s career, like a mini survey, and are guaranteed to lift your spirits. Then bliss out in the secluded, octagonal-shaped &ldquo;chapel&rdquo; of seven paintings by Agnes Martin.</li>\n<li><strong>Third Floor:</strong> This level is largely devoted to <a href="http://www.sftravel.com/article/5-picture-perfect-destinations-photography-lover">photography</a>, one of SFMOMA&rsquo;s great points of distinction. But on a tight schedule you may have to save that for another time. Instead check out the delightful Alexander Calder &ldquo;motion lab&rdquo; (on view through Sept. 17, 2017) and experience a concentration of the artist&rsquo;s mobiles that extends into an outdoor terrace framed by a gigantic vertical garden. Indoor-outdoor visitor circulation creates airflow into these galleries, which allows the sculptures to do their thing.&nbsp;Then get your afternoon caffeine fix at the new Sightglass coffee bar.&nbsp;</li>\n<li><strong>Second Floor:</strong> You must at least whiz through SFMOMA&rsquo;s re-envisioned permanent collection galleries, stopping to say hello to greatest hits like Matisse&rsquo;s <em>Femme au Chapeau</em> and Mark Rothko&rsquo;s luminous <em>14, 1960, </em>among other old friends like Frida Kahlo&rsquo;s self-portrait with hubby Diego Rivera and important works by Robert Rauschenberg (another great strength of the collection). Grab a souvenir from the new Museum Store outpost in the ticketing court where you started.</li>\n<li><strong>Ground Floor:</strong> Grab a souvenir from the new Museum Store outpost in the ticketing court where you started, then (literally) wind your way through Richard Serra&rsquo;s behemoth walk-in sculpture <em>Sequence</em> and out the door of SFMOMA&rsquo;s new glass-walled gallery facing Howard Street.</li>\n</ul>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>7.

The city also plays home to incredible resort style spas where guests are treated to heavenly relaxation. Orlando is most definitely among the world&rsquo;s premier destinations with an array of fun and exciting things to do that keeps most visitors coming back to experience more fun.</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>2. History of Foundation</strong></p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Prior to the arrival of the first European settlers in 1837, the area that is now Orlando was occupied by the Seminole tribe of Native Americans. Historians believe that the Seminoles, whose named is said to mean "wild and separate," inhabited the Central Florida region for 6,000 to 12,000 years. The Second Seminole War, which spanned the period from 1835 to 1842, began when disagreements arose between the natives and the American settlers on such issues as land, cattle, and slaves. In the years following the war the natives moved away, leaving the pioneers who built their town around Fort Gatlin. Until 1845 Orange County, of which the city of Orlando is the county seat, was known as Mosquito County. Tradition holds that Orlando was named after Orlando Reeves, an American soldier on sentinel duty for a scouting party. While Reeves' companion slept, a native approached disguised as a rolling log. Reeves, seeing what was occurring, fired his gun, woke the other soldiers, and saved them from peril. However, Reeves himself succumbed to an arrow shot by the native. Prior to receiving the name Orlando in 1857, the town was known as Jernigan, after Aaron Jernigan, a settler from Georgia.</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;">During the 1880s, some of the pioneers started growing citrus trees. The growth of Orlando in size and prosperity was associated with the need for better transportation to citrus markets on the part of citrus growers. The city had its first rail lines by 1881. During the 1880s and 1890s, there was an influx of new fruit growers. In 1885, Rollins College was founded in Winter Park. By 1886, the city&rsquo;s streets were lined with office buildings, churches, hotels, and schools, and tourists from the north began to spend summers in the area.</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Disaster struck in 1894 when a three-day freeze destroyed nearly all the citrus trees in Orange County. The freeze had a devastating effect on the community, which suffered losses of an estimated $100 million. Packing plants closed, bank closed, people lost their job, and it was 15 years before Orlando fully recovered.</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Between 1910 and 1920 the population of Orlando doubled, and the city was transformed from a rural citrus growing area to a major city. During the 1920s a great building boom aided in Orlando's continuing prosperity, evidenced by the opening of the Orlando Public Library in 1923 and the Municipal Auditorium (now Bob Carr Auditorium) in 1926. During the Great Depression of the 1930s, the federal government's Works Progress Administration programs aided in the upgrading of the Municipal Airport, the building of a new football stadium at Tinker Field, and park development, and by 1944 many new jobs had been created. Another building boom followed World War II, and new suburbs, new roadways, and new shopping centres were built.</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The development of Walt Disney World in 1971 spurred a construction boom that included apartment buildings, hotels and motels, banks, commercial shopping areas, and tourist-related businesses. The city's Municipal Justice Building was erected in 1972 and Sea World of Florida followed in 1973. Tourism increased, thanks to tourist sites such as Epcot Center built in 1982, and the Disney-MGM Studios theme park, which opened in 1989. To the dismay of many local people, what had once been a sleepy backwater town was rapidly becoming a world class tourist mecca. The town of Orlando was recognized as one of the world's most popular vacation sites.</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>3. Area &amp; Population</strong></p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Orlando is a city in the U.S State of Florida, and the county seat of Orange County. Located in the centre of the Orlando metropolitan area, it is the 24<sup>th</sup> largest metropolitan area in the United States, the sixth-largest metropolitan area in the Southern United States. The geography of Orlando is mostly wetlands, consisting of many lakes and swamps. The terrain is generally flat, making the land fairly low and wet. The area is dotted with hundreds of lakes, the largest of which is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Apopka">Lake Apopka</a>. Central Florida's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bedrock">bedrock</a> is mostly <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limestone">limestone</a> and very porous; the Orlando area is susceptible to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinkholes">sinkholes</a>. Probably the most famous incident involving a sinkhole happened in 1981 in Winter Park, a city immediately north of downtown Orlando, dubbed &ldquo;The Winter Park Sinkhole&rdquo;.</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;">There are 115 neighbourhoods within the city limits of Orlando and many unincorporated communities. Orlando's city limits resemble a checkerboard, with pockets of unincorporated Orange County surrounded by city limits.</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The city&rsquo;s population is estimated to be around 271,000 in 2015 with 57.6% of the population is White. Hispanic/ or Latino took 28.4% of the population, 25% of the city is African American, whereas those from Asian ancestry living in the city took 3.8% of the total population, and the rest are Native American, Pacific Islander, and multiracial.</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>4. Facts &amp; Figures</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Orlando has earned a number of nicknames over the years, including City Phenomenal, and City Different. Today, it&rsquo;s commonly referred to as the City Beautiful.</li>\n<li>A whopping 62 million people visited Orlando in 2014, helping it shoot past Las Vegas to become the most-visited tourist destination in the United States.</li>\n<li>Encompassing more than 40 square miles, Walt Disney World Resort is so enormous that all of Manhattan (33.7 square miles) could easily squeeze within its confines.</li>\n<li>Orlando has long been a popular location for filming movies including &ldquo;Jaws 3&rdquo;, &ldquo;My Girl&rdquo;, &ldquo;Parenthood&rdquo;, &ldquo;Problem Child 2&rdquo;, &ldquo;Lethal Weapon&rdquo;, &ldquo;Dead Presidents&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Waterboy&rdquo;.</li>\n<li>Both boybands Backstreet Boys and N*Sync started in Orlando.</li>\n<li>More than 100 lakes dot Orlando&rsquo;s environs. But in a case of mistaken identity, Lake Eola, one the region&rsquo;s most famous bodies of water, is actually a massive sinkhole measuring 80 feet at its deepest point.</li>\n<li>The Citrus Bowl was the site of five 1994 World Cup soccer matches and also hosted the 1996 Olympic soccer first and second rounds.</li>\n<li>Showcase of Citrus is a working citrus farm just west of Walt Disney World, and in nearby Lake Wales is Florida's Natural Growers, where Florida orange juice is made.</li>\n<li>Gatorland was the first theme park to open in Orlando in 1949. Its main attraction was a 15-foot gator, said to the biggest in the world.</li>\n<li>Among the original rides at the Magic Kingdom were Jungle Cruise, Pirates of the Caribbean, the Carousel of Progress, the Mark Twain Riverboat, It's a Small World, Tomorrowland Speedway, Dumbo the Flying Elephant, the Carousel, Mad Tea Party, Swiss Family Treehouse, the Country Bear Jamboree and the Enchanted Tiki Room, all of which are around today.</li>\n<li>The Wizarding World of Harry Potter opened at Universal&rsquo;s Island of Adventures in 2010. Disney had the rights to Harry Potter first, but sources say J.K. Rowling went with Universal for better collaboration.</li>\n</ul>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>5. Weather</strong></p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Orlando has a humid subtropical climate and transitional climate similar to Tampa. There are two major seasons each year. One is hot and rainy, lasting from May until late September (roughly coinciding with the Atlantic hurricane season). The other is the dry, relatively mild season (late October through April) bringing less frequent rainfall, yet still with warm temperatures.</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;">During the height of Orlando's humid summer season, high temperatures are typically in the lower to mid-90s &deg;F (32&ndash;36&nbsp;&deg;C), while low temperatures rarely fall below 70&nbsp;&deg;F (21&nbsp;&deg;C). During September, strong afternoon thunderstorms occur almost daily. These storms are caused by air masses from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_of_Mexico">Gulf of Mexico</a> and the Atlantic Ocean colliding over Central Florida. They are highlighted by spectacular <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightning">lightning</a> and can also bring heavy rain (sometimes several inches per hour) and powerful winds as well as occasional damaging <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hail">hail</a>.</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;">During the cooler seasons, humidity is lower and temperatures are more moderate, and can fluctuate more readily. The monthly daily average temperature in January is 60.2&nbsp;&deg;F (15.7&nbsp;&deg;C).&nbsp; Because the winter season is dry and freezing temperatures usually occur only after cold fronts (and their accompanying precipitation) have passed, snow is exceptionally rare.</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>6.

Initially, its purpose was to train dancers to appear in opera productions, but it separated from the opera in 1942 and was renamed SF Ballet. Headed by brothers <a href="https://www.sfballet.org/planyourvisit/learn/christensen_brothers#harold">Willam</a>, <a href="https://www.sfballet.org/planyourvisit/learn/christensen_brothers#lew">Lew</a>, and <a href="https://www.sfballet.org/planyourvisit/learn/christensen_brothers#harold">Harold</a> Christensen from the late &rsquo;30s until the &rsquo;70s, it made its mark early on by staging the first full-length American productions of <em>Swan Lake</em> (1940) and <em>Nutcracker </em>(1944)<em>. </em>Under Lew&rsquo;s direction, the Company made its East Coast debut at Jacob&rsquo;s Pillow Dance Festival in 1956 and toured 11 Asian nations the following year, marking the first performances of an American ballet company in the Far East. In October 2013, the Company performed at New York&rsquo;s David H. Koch Theater at Lincoln Center, where <em>The New York Times</em> declared SF Ballet &ldquo;a national treasure.&rdquo; 2015 marks the 30<sup>th</sup> anniversary of Helgi Tomasson&rsquo;s tenure as artistic director of SF Ballet.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>2. Must-try San Francisco Invented Cocktails:</strong></p>\n<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><strong>a. Cable Car:</strong> created in 1996 by Tony Abou-Ganim at the <a href="http://www.sftravel.com/explore/hotels/sir-francis-drake-hotel">Sir Francis Drake&rsquo;s</a> <a href="http://www.sftravel.com/explore/nightlife/starlight-room">Starlight Room</a>. It&rsquo;s an intriguing little twist on the classic sidecar that swaps the original&rsquo;s cognac for Captain Morgan&rsquo;s spiced rum, but keeps the orange liqueur and lemon juice. It also adds a cinnamon sugar rim as a garnish, adding to the spice profile of the cocktail.</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><strong>b. California Milk Punch:</strong> invented by the famous Jerry Thomas during his stint in San Francisco, and uses ingredients as eclectic as the city itself, including lemon, pineapple, green tea, brandy, Jamaican rum, cloves, coriander, cinnamon, and of course milk. The idea behind this milk punch is to curdle the milk and then strain the solids, leaving behind all the nasty particulates, and resulting in a creamy, preservable drink ready for bottling.</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><strong>c. Pisco Punch:</strong> Pisco (which is distilled from Peruvian grape varietals) made its way up to the city from Peru via traders in the 1830s. When the Bank Exchange &amp; Billiard Saloon opened in 1853, it was only natural that they would offer a variety of punches, and the availability of pisco made it a perfect candidate. Duncan Nicol is credited with the original recipe, with pisco, pineapple, lime juice, gum arabic, and water, which was described at the time as &ldquo;like lemonade but comes back with the kick of a roped steer.&rdquo;</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><strong>d. Martini:</strong> After a rough decade being transmogrified into a plethora of sickly sweet &lsquo;tinis, the &ldquo;only American invention as perfect as a sonnet&rdquo; is finally experiencing a glorious comeback. First things first: a martini is made with gin, not vodka. It traces its roots to the classic Martinez (which allegedly was invented just up the bay in the city of the same name) which called for gin, vermouth, and maraschino liqueur. Sometime in the 1860s, the Occidental Hotel in San Francisco dropped the liqueur from the recipe, and the martini was born.</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>3. Winery:</strong></p>\n<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><strong>a. Bluxome Street Winery (53 Bluxome St.):</strong> you&rsquo;ll get a taste of wine and San Francisco history. A reel of old video footage shows San Francisco around the turn of the century (19th to 20th) and those behind the bar can tell you a few things about the area formerly known as &ldquo;South of the Slot&rdquo; before it became &ldquo;SOMA.&rdquo; Mostly though, there&rsquo;s a slough of Russian River wines with Pinot Noir being the focus.</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><strong>b. Chateau Montelena (335 Powell St.):</strong> Chateau Montelena itself is a California landmark and if you can make it up to the winery that is preferable but if not, just step into the Westin St. Francis on Union Square and check out the tasting room in the lobby. The standards are always open and usually there is also a special wine or two being poured.</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><strong>c. Jax Vineyards and Tasting Room (326 Brannan St.):</strong> The first Jax wine was made in a San Francisco garage so it makes complete sense that this family owned and run winery would choose to set up shop within the city&rsquo;s borders. They started out working with the Bordeaux varieties from their home vineyard in Calistoga but have since branched out to make other wines sourcing fruit from other parts of Napa and Sonoma.</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><strong>d. Wattle Creek Winery (900 North Point St.):</strong> Located in the Alexander Valley an hour and a half north of San Francisco, without traffic, Wattle Creek serves up a selection of wines from their estate vineyard. There is a good variety of wines to choose from so no matter what your taste, or how many in your party, everyone should discover something that fits their palate.</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><strong>e. Winery Collective (495 Jefferson St.):</strong> Over a dozen wineries are represented at this outpost in Fisherman&rsquo;s Wharf with a narrower range poured by the glass. Three flights are offered starting with the introductory Locals Flight to the more complex &ldquo;Urban Flight.&rdquo; There are also ten wines poured by the glass selected from the members of the collective.</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>4. Bars at SOMA:</strong></p>\n<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><strong>a. Alchemist Bar &amp; lounge (679 3<sup>rd</sup>):</strong> Alchemist is tucked away on the second floor of a building around the corner from the ballpark. This makes it feel a little bit like a speakeasy and the Steampunk d&eacute;cor promotes that. The space has a loft-like feel, which will make you feel even more as if you stumbled into someone&rsquo;s private party. Swanky as the Alchemist might be, this place is very serious about its cocktails. Ingredients are sourced from Chinese herbalists and artisan purveyors.</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><strong>b. Dirty Water (1355 Market St.):</strong> on the ground floor of the Twitter building, across from The Market, San Francisco&rsquo;s latest gourmet epicenter. The space is open and industrial and it looks great during the day or when the sun goes down. And this is perfect as there are so many delicious drinks offered that you might want to make your choice based on the time of day: vodka in the afternoon, whiskey at night. Or not. Although it is still very new to San Francisco, Dirty Water has nailed its cocktail program and also has an extensive cheese selection and small plates, so be prepared for a long hang out, possibly from day into night.</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><strong>c. Monarch (101 6<sup>th</sup>):</strong> Upstairs, Monarch is a bar and one of the most stylish you&rsquo;ll find in SOMA with plenty of throwback pieces from different eras that seamlessly match. There are a few little nooks for chats with friends but the place has a lively vibe. And, if lively is what you want, check out the downstairs club featuring popular DJ&rsquo;s most nights. Not least, the drinks are killer with several original cocktails such as the Monkey Wrench, a tequila based cocktail that goes down way too easily. However, you can order a Jack and Coke without getting any &ldquo;holier than thou&rdquo; attitude from the bartenders. It&rsquo;s the real deal and there are &ldquo;Amazing Hour&rdquo; drink specials 5:30&ndash;7:30, with various forms of entertainment and festivities.</p>\n<p>Reference:</p>\n<p><a href="http://www.sftravel.com">http://www.sftravel.com</a></p>\n<p><a href="http://www.sanfrancisco.com">http://www.sanfrancisco.com</a></p>	san_francisco.jpg	\N	\N	on	1	2017-02-13 00:37:55.974401+00	2017-02-13 00:37:55.974401+00	39	4

54	General Information		\N	<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>1.&nbsp;</strong><strong>Introduction</strong></p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Boston is the capital and the largest city of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts in the United States. It is one of the oldest and most historic cities in North America with a very European feel. Boston is extremely diverse with cultures, as well as some of the top universities on the planet &ndash; primarily in technology, health care and finance. Boston is a unique city where one must visit when exploring America.</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>2. History of Foundation</strong></p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Boston was founded on the Shawmut Peninsula in 1630 by Puritan settlers from England. Many of the crucial events of the American Revolution - such as the Boston Massacre, the Boston Tea Party, Paul Reverse&rsquo;s midnight ride, the battles of Lexington and Concord and Bunker Hill, the Siege of Boston, and many others &ndash; occurred in or near Boston. After the Revolution, Boston&rsquo;s long seafaring tradition helped make it one of the world&rsquo;s wealthiest international ports, with the slave trade, rum, fish, salt, and tobacco being particularly important.</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The Embargo Act of 1807, adopted during the Napoleonic Wars, and the War of 1812 significantly curtailed Boston&rsquo;s harbour activity. Manufacturing became an important component of the city&rsquo;s economy, and by the mid-19<sup>th</sup> century, the city&rsquo;s industrial manufacturing overtook international trade in economic importance. Until the early 20<sup>th</sup> century, Boston remained one of the nation&rsquo;s largest manufacturing centres and was notable for its garment production and leather-goods industries. During this period, Boston flourished culturally as well, admired for its rarefied literary life and generous artistic patronage, with members of old Boston families &ndash; eventually dubbed Boston Brahmins &ndash; coming to be regarded as the nation&rsquo;s social and cultural elites.</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;">By the early and mid-20<sup>th</sup> century, the city was in decline as factories became old and obsolete, and businesses moved out of the region for cheaper labour elsewhere. Boston responded by initiating various urban renewal projects under the direction of the Boston Redevelopment Authority (BRA), which was established in 1957. However, its extensive demolishing project to improve the historic West End neighbourhood was met with strong public opposition.</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Boston was an intellectual, technological and political centre but has lost some important regional institutions, including the loss to merges and acquisitions of local financial institution such as FleetBoston Financial in 2004. Boston-based department stores Jordan Marsh and Filene&rsquo;s have both been merged into the Cincinnati-based Marcy&rsquo;s.&nbsp; The city has experienced gentrification in the latter half of the 20<sup>th</sup> century, with housing prices increasing sharply since the 1900s. Living expenses have risen, making Boston one of the highest costs of living in the United States.</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Boston, however, ranks high on liveability ratings, raking 36<sup>th</sup> worldwide and sitting in the top 3 most liveable large cities in the United States (with San Francisco and Seattle) in 2015.</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>3. Area &amp; Populations</strong></p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Boston has an area of total 89.6 square miles (232.1 km&sup2;). 54% of the city is land and the 46% is of water. The highest point in Boston is Mount Greylock at 3489 feet (1063m) above sea level, and the lowest point is at sea level. Situated onshore of the Atlantic Ocean, Boston is the only state capital in the contiguous United States with an oceanic coastline.</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Boston is surrounded by the &ldquo;Greater Boston&rdquo; region and is contiguously bordered by the cities and towns of Winthrop, Revere, Chelsea, Everett, Somerville, Cambridge, Newton, Brookline, Needham, Dedham, Canton, Milton, and Quincy.</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The iconic Charles River separates Boston from Watertown and the majority of Cambridge, and the mass of Boston from its on Charlestown neighbourhood.</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Boston is sometimes called a &ldquo;city of neighbourhood&rdquo; because the profusion of diverse subsections; the city government&rsquo;s Office of Neighbourhood Services has officially designated 23 neighbourhoods. More than two-third of inner Boston&rsquo;s modern land area did not exist when the city was founded, but was created visa the gradual filling in of the surrounding tidal areas over the centuries.</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Downtown and its immediate surroundings consists largely of low-rise (often Federal style and Greek Revival) masonry buildings, interspersed with modern high-rises, notably in the Financial District, Government Centre, and South Boston. Back Bay includes many prominent landmarks, such as the Boston Public Library, Christian Science Center, Copley Square, Newbury Street, and New England&rsquo;s two tallest buildings- the John Hancock Tower and the Prudential Center. The South End Historic District is the largest surviving contiguous Victorian-era neighbourhood in the US. The geography of downtown and South Boston was particularly impacted by the Tunnel Project, which allowd for the removal of the unsightly elevated Central Artery and the incorporation of new green spaces and open areas.</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Boston has a population of approximately 617 600 in 2015, with Caucasian (especially Irish descent) make up 53% of the population, follows by 24% Black, 17% Hispanic or Latino, Asian make up 8% of the total population and the rest is other races &ndash; including American Indian and Native Hawaiian Pacific Islander.</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;">About 57% of the city&rsquo;s population identified themselves as Christian, while 33% claim no religious affiliation and the 10% rest follow other religions (including Buddhism, Judaism, Hinduism, and Islam).</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>4. Fun Facts</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Boston is actually named after a town in England as many of Boston&rsquo;s early settlers were from Boston, England, and decided to keep the name.</li>\n<li>Boston is home to the oldest public park in the U.S., which is Boston Common &ndash; a green sanctuary within the city of Boston dates back to 1634.</li>\n<li>&ldquo;Happy Hours&rdquo; are against the law. You won&rsquo;t find any &ldquo;Happy Hour&rdquo; signs in the local Boston pub because the typical post-work drink deals have been banned since 1989.</li>\n<li>The Fig Newton (a favourite American sweet snack) is actually named after the Boston suburb of Newton, Massachusetts.</li>\n<li>Boston was home to the first U.S chocolate factory, which was built in the Lower Mills section in the Dorchester neighbourhood of Boston.</li>\n<li>Boston built America&rsquo;s first subway, the Tremont Street Subway, back in 1897.</li>\n<li>Boston was also home to the first public beach in the U.S, which was Revere Beach.</li>\n<li>In 1880, candlepin bowling was invented in Boston. Candlepin bowling is similar to the tenpin bowling most are familiar with, with a few key differences in equipment.</li>\n<li>You can drive 90 feet below the earth&rsquo;s surface in Boston, as the Ted Williams Tunnel is the deepest in North America, running nearly 90 feet underneath the earth&rsquo;s surface.</li>\n<li>Christmas was once banned. Bostonians couldn&rsquo;t celebrate Christmas between 1659 &ndash; 1681 because it was against the law as the Pilgrims believed it to be a corrupted holiday.</li>\n<li>The biggest art theft to date occurred in Boston on 18<sup>th</sup> March, 1990. Two thieves posing as cops stole 12 paintings worth a total of $100 million from the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum.</li>\n<li>Bostonians get the weather from a skyscraper: Coloured lights on top of the old John Hancock Tower tell Bostonians the daily weather forecast. The options are solid blue, meaning it&rsquo;s a clear day; flashing blue, signifying a cloudy day or clouds are comings; solid red, saying there&rsquo;s rain coming; and flashing red, meaning snow is coming. In the summer, flashing red means the Red Sox game is rained out.</li>\n</ul>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>5. Weather</strong></p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Boston has a humid continental climate with some maritime influence. Summers are typically warm to hot, rainy, and humid. The hottest month is July, with a mean temperature of 23 &deg;C (73.4 &deg;F), exceeding to 32 &deg;C (90 &deg;F). Winters oscillate between periods of cold rain and snow, with cold temperature. The coldest month is January, with a mean of -1.7 &deg;C (29 &deg;F), exceeding to -18 &deg;C (0 &deg;F). Spring and fall are usually mild, with varying conditions dependent on wind direction and jet stream positioning. Prevailing wind patterns that blow offshore minimise the influence of the Atlantic Ocean.</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Fog is fairly common, particularly in spring and summer, and the occasional tropical storm or hurricane can threaten the region, especially in late summer and early autumn. Due to its situation along the North Atlantic, the city of ten receives sea breezes, especially in late spring.</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Thunderstorms occur from May to September, that are occasionally severe with large hail, damaging winds and heavy downpours. Damaging storms are more common to areas north, west and northwest of the city.</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>6.

Forbes Island (PIER 39):</strong> this restaurant is on an island (a manmade one, but still, it&rsquo;s an <a href="http://www.sanfrancisco.travel/article/islands-san-francisco-bay">island in San Francisco Bay</a>). You&rsquo;ll even be picked up on a little boat for a quick jaunt to the island (say hello to the <a href="http://www.sanfrancisco.travel/article/sounds-san-francisco-podcast-pier-39-sea-lions">sea lions</a>) and be sure to climb the lighthouse for a great view. The main dining room is underwater (there are a few portholes where you can see the water). The set menu is Continental/American, with options including a tasty mushroom ragout and lamb lollipops.</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><strong>b. Tonga Room (950 Mason St):</strong> Located at Fairmont San Francisco, Tonga Room &amp;&nbsp;Hurricane Bar has delighted guests with its tropical d&eacute;cor, decadent libations and Asian cuisine since 1945.&nbsp; Having reigned as a swanky outpost of South Seas high style for much of its storied history, Tonga Room more recently gained a following as an icon of tiki&rsquo;s pop culture heyday of the 1940s and 1950s. Following a $1 million restoration by Gensler San Francisco, Tonga Room has rekindled the excitement of its unique and time-honoured d&eacute;cor to recapture the glory of one of the nation&rsquo;s first tiki palaces. Tonga Room has been recognized as one of the nation&rsquo;s hottest bars by <em>InStyle, Gourmet, Travel &amp; Leisure, Harper&rsquo;s Bazaar </em>and <em>Wallpaper</em> magazines and has been recently featured on <em>ABC, Travel Channel </em>&amp;&nbsp;<em>Food Network</em>.</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><strong>c. Farallon (450 Post St.):</strong> Walking into this <a href="http://www.sanfrancisco.travel/explore/neighborhoods/union-square">Union Square</a> restaurant is like entering an underwater fantasy, with aquatic elements throughout. The Jellyfish Lounge is a playfully designed place to come by for <a href="http://www.sanfrancisco.travel/article/drop-everything-8-happy-hours-you-need-check-out-now">happy hour</a> and oysters from the raw bar, while the dining room is high on drama, but still elegant. As you&rsquo;d expect, the menu highlights <a href="http://www.sanfrancisco.travel/article/best-seafood-san-francisco">seafood</a>, but here it&rsquo;s also sustainable and top of the line, featuring the best of what&rsquo;s in season. *Tip: don&rsquo;t miss the carrot cake for dessert.</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><strong>d. AsiaSF (201 Ninth St.):</strong> In 1998 Larry Hashbarger and Skip Young opened AsiaSF. &nbsp;This restaurant-lounge-dance club quickly became a San Francisco entertainment landmark.

A San Francisco Chronicle &ldquo;Top 100 Restaurant&rdquo; for sixteen consecutive years, Chefs Gayle Piric and John Clark&rsquo;s collective visions weave food, wine, cocktails, film, and art gallery into one harmonious ambience. This is considered one of the most atmospheric venues in the city, where they screen films on the back wall while you dine (there are also drive-in style speakers at the tables so you can listen to the movie in the background). The Cal-Med menu includes quality charcuterie, oysters, seasonal dishes, and if you&rsquo;re lucky you&rsquo;ll find their incredible fried chicken too.</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><strong>f. Lazy Bear (3416 19<sup>th</sup>):</strong> Lazy Bear sells tickets to their dinner, much like a concert. Each month, tickets for two seated dinners per night go on sale and are usually scooped up quickly. The dinners include communal seating and a 14-plus-course tasting menu with prices varying by day and time. Diners don&rsquo;t know what they&rsquo;ll be eating until they arrive as the menu changes by meal. The chefs come out and describe each dish to the diners as they all are served and eat together. It&rsquo;s like a dinner party, but with new friends instead of established ones.</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><strong>g.

Opaque (689 McAllister St.):</strong> Dining in the dark is literal at Opaque.

Before entering the dark room, diners are able to view a menu to choose their meal, which is created by a sighted chef. Opaque is a unique place to experience food while using your other senses to create a complete picture.</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>2. Famous Local Restaurants:</strong></p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>a. For Business Dinner:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><u>Boulevard (1 Mission St.):</u></strong> Iconic, landmark and institution are just a few of the words that can be used to describe the 2012 James Beard Award Winner for Outstanding Restaurant, Boulevard. Chef-partner Nancy Oakes and partner Pat Kuleto opened the eatery in 1993 and at the time, the market-driven high-end American cuisine was revolutionary. Today, Boulevard is a quality old guard restaurant that serves up delicious and reliable classics in an unpretentious, but refined setting. The large restaurant, which is located on the Embarcadero and has gorgeous views of the bay, seats 150, plus 26 at the bar. It also has extensive private dining options, with room for up to 64 people, so if you&rsquo;re planning a banquet of some sorts, you should definitely consider Boulevard. Specialties include the ahi tuna tartare with seven spice powder and nori crisp; Dungeness crab and endive salad with ruby grapefruit, avocado and green goddess dressing, and the roast lamb T-bone with morels stuffed with St. Andreas cheese, nettle and parsley potatoes</li>\n<li><strong><u>Kokkari Estiatorio (200 Jackson St.):</u></strong> been serving San Francisco&rsquo;s community of businessmen and women on the corner of Jackson and Front streets for many years. It&rsquo;s also a massive restaurant with 185 seats, several dining rooms, and various types of seating that can accommodate an intimate group of four and a rowdy crowd of 20. Kokkari is one of those warm, welcoming, bustling restaurants where regulars encourage newcomers to try the traditional whole grilled fish with lemon, waiters pour heavy glasses of Assyrtiko, a minerally white Greek wine varietal, and everyone&mdash;from the staff to the diners have a grand old time. Unlike some newer restaurants that have a highly edited menu, Kokkari&rsquo;s offerings are extensive and mouthwatering. Some personal favorites include the gigantic baked beans with tomato sauce, olive oil and feta; the grilled calamari stuffed with feta, fennel, orange and black olives, and the authentic moussaka, a traditional Greek casserole with spiced lamb, eggplant, potato and yogurt b&eacute;chamel.</li>\n<li><strong><u>Perbacco (230 California St.):</u></strong> If you&rsquo;re a lover of Italian food and want your successful transaction with a side of housemade tagliatelle and five-hour pork sugo, you can&rsquo;t beat Perbacco. The bi-level restaurant is in the heart of the Financial District along the cable car route that runs up and down California Street. Everything about Perbacco is precise, curated, and detail-oriented, from the chive garnish placed just-so on the broccoli puree to the comprehensive wine list dotted with exceptional French, American and Italian bottles. There is an excellent charcuterie program with a selection of house cured salumi, all of the pastas are handmade in house, and the dessert options are plentiful, in both sweet and savory preparations</li>\n<li><strong><u>Pabu (101 California St):</u></strong> a high-end sushi eatery. When you&rsquo;re looking for the freshest seafood and the most interesting bottles of Japanese whisky, there&rsquo;s only one place to find it, Pabu. Michael Mina and chef Ken Tominaga&rsquo;s buzzy, sleek and happening restaurant is a stunning modern izakaya on California Street near the cable car turnaround. There are several private rooms and booths, as well as a chef&rsquo;s counter where diners can watch the sushi chefs filet fresh toro and season it ever so slightly with smoke or salt to make the most delectable bites of sashimi around. There is also finger-licking good robata skewers of chicken tail or pork belly, soothing miso soup with silken tofu, and American wagyu beef shabu shabu. On weekend nights the crowds can be a little loud, so if you&rsquo;re hosting an event on the company dime on Friday or Saturday, it might be worth booking a private room.</li>\n<li><strong><u>Q (1085 Mission St):</u></strong> A.Q is elegant with wood tables topped with seasonal d&eacute;cor. In fact, everything about A.Q. is a celebration of the current season: the decor, the cocktails, the food and even the website are inspired by spring, summer, autumn or winter. It makes A.Q. a fun restaurant to visit throughout the year, as each time you go, the menu, look and feel is completely different. There are two options to enjoying the upscale California cuisine: a four-course prix fixe menu or a chef&rsquo;s tasting menu. Either are scrumptious choices and do splurge on the innovative beverage pairing&mdash;it's definitely worth it!</li>\n</ul>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>b. Historic Landmark Restaurants:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><u>Tadich Grill (240 California St.):</u></strong> Mad Men-style martinis are in demand at the old-school dining room, the nation's first mesquite grill. "We serve 300 martinis a day, a testimonial to our long-standing traditions," says manager David Hanna. Although the restaurant made several moves prior to settling at 240 California St. in 1967, its current location gets the Instagrammable plaque, &ldquo;California&rsquo;s Oldest Restaurant.&rdquo; Take a seat at the long mahogany bar or settle into the dining room where wood-paneled walls and white linens add to the club feel. Servers are pros, sporting traditional white jacket and tie to serve up tasty sourdough bread, signature cioppino and a very decent Bloody Mary.</li>\n<li><strong><u>Sam&rsquo;s Grill &amp; Seafood Restaurant (374 Bush St.):</u></strong> The story of Sam's begins with an affable Irishman named Mike who sold the bay&rsquo;s abundant fresh oysters from a waterfront stall in 1867. That enterprise evolved into an oyster saloon. During Prohibition in the 1920s, an owner named Sam stepped into the picture. He experimented with a re-branding using his and his partner's surnames. Zembolich &amp; Zenovich was short-lived (surprised?), so Sam&rsquo;s Grill stuck. Sam&rsquo;s Grill has hosted&nbsp;special moments and whispered secrets for 150 years. Much-loved for a classic Old Fashioned and the freshest daily market fish, Sam&rsquo;s owners have preserved the timeless look and feel of the place. You can even draw the curtains at your private, cosy dining booth where a bell will summon your waiter.&nbsp;</li>\n<li><strong><u>Cliff House (1090 Point Lobos Ave.):</u> </strong>Once host to presidents and wealthy Victorian society, the oceanfront destination alternatively went through periods of popularity among high life and riff-raff. It was adjacent to the immensely popular turn-of-the-20th-century Sutro Baths, then shuttered during Prohibition. Later, it was the centerpiece of a fabled 10-acre amusement park attracting thousands weekly. Although this&nbsp;place with an 1863 birth certificate survived earthquakes, it suffered destruction by fire twice, including an 1887 explosion aboard an offshore schooner wreck. Cliff House started all over again each time in the same Lands&rsquo; End spot. the Cliff House has a live webcam and a website noting the time of sunset, so guests can perfectly time a visit. Settle in with a Ramos Fizz at the Zinc Bar, with its hand-carved back bar salvaged from the 1889 Paris Expo, and stay for Friday night jazz. Take a window table to enjoy house specialties of clam chowder, Crab Louis and the housemade popovers.</li>\n</ul>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>c. When visiting Museums:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><u>In Situ at SFMOMA:</u></strong> Chef Corey Lee has previously received three Michelin Stars, and now he is serving up a brand new dining experience. In Situ will have a revolving menu that, over the course of a year, will feature 90 dishes. Some items call for ingredients that are only available for a few weeks each year.</li>\n<li><strong><u>Caf&eacute; Asia at Asian Art Museum</u>:</strong> Cafe Asia does not require you to pay museum admission to enjoy its rich Asian cuisine, but the experience is nevertheless designed to accompany a gallery visit &mdash; taking your day from exceptional to outstanding. From Japanese Curry Chicken to Seaweed Salads to its limited edition dong po rou (pork belly), served in honor of the "Meat-Shaped Stone" on display with the <a href="http://www.sftravel.com/article/coming-soon-emperors-treasures-asian-art-museum">Emperor's Treasures</a>, Chef Melinda Quirino's menu will give you a memorable dining experience.</li>\n<li><strong><u>de Young Caf&eacute; at de Young Museum:</u></strong> where the ingredients are sourced locally and the farming connections are sustainable.

You'll find everything from house-made bagels to double-baked rye, and the smoked pastrami is piled high to keep your belly full while you wander the galleries at CJM.

67	General Information		\N	<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>1. Introduction</strong></p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Las Vegas, often known as Vegas, is a city in the United States, the most populous city in the state of Nevada, the county seat of Clark County, and the city proper of the Las Vegas Valley. &ldquo;What happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas!&rdquo;. Las Vegas called itself The Entertainment Capital of the World as it&rsquo;s famous for all the mega casino hotels, major resorts, extremely colourful nightlife and associated entertainment.</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The city is one of the top three leading destinations in the United States for conventions, business, and meetings. In addition, the city&rsquo;s metropolitan area has more AAA Five Diamond hotels than any other city in the world, and is a global leader in the hospitality industry. It&rsquo;s an understatement to say that today, Las Vegas is one of the top tourist destinations in the world.</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>2. History of Foundation</strong></p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The name Las Vegas comes from Spanish for &ldquo;the meadows&rdquo;. The land was originally the home to the Navajo and other nomadic American Indians. In 1829, a Mexican trader by the name of Antonio Armijo came across what he called a grassland meadow, hence the name Las Vegas for that area. In 1855, the Mormons sent a small group of settlers to help the local Indians plant crops and set up a safe way station between Los Angeles and Salt Lake City, but by 1857, the safe way station was abandoned.</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;">In 1905, the city of Las Vegas was established. In 1931, two things happened that would forever change Las Vegas and help to shape the city&rsquo;s future&rsquo;s path. The first thing was the construction on the Hoover Dam began, and thousands of workers were brought in to the city. At the same time, casino gambling was legalised. For years, the city struggled as a small town until Bugsy Siegel, the infamous New York mobster, opened his Flamingo Hotel in 1946.</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Following World War II, lavishly decorated hotels, gambling casinos and big-name entertainment became synonymous with Las Vegas. The 1950s saw the opening of the Moulin Rouge, the first racially integrated casino-hotel in Las Vegas. During the 1960s, corporations and business powerhouses such as Howard Hughes were building and buying hotel-casino properties. Gambling was referred to as &ldquo;gaming&rdquo;, which transitioned into legitimate business. In 1989, entrepreneur Steve Wynn changed the face of the Las Vegas gaming industry by opening up The Mirage, the Las Vegas&rsquo;s first mega-casino resort. The year 1995 marked the opening of the Fremont Street Experience in Las Vegas&rsquo;s downtown area. This canopied, five-block area features 12.5 million LED lights and 550,000 watts of sound from dusk until midnight shows help on the top of each hour, turned Vegas into a city that truly never sleeps.</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>3. Area &amp; Population</strong></p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Las Vegas is situated within Clark County in a basin on the floor of the Mojave Desert, and is surrounded by mountain ranges of all sides. Much of the landscape is rocky and arid with desert vegetation and wildlife. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 135.86 square miles (351.9 km&sup2;), of which 99.7% is land with a very small area covered with water. Within the city, there are many lawns, trees and other greenery. Due to water resource issues, there has been a movement to encourage conservation programs aiming to reserve water and landscape.</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Las Vegas has a population of approximately 603,500 people, with White takes up 47.9% of the population. Black or African American is 11.1% of the population, while Hispanic or Latino is 31.5%, Asian only 6.1%. The city&rsquo;s most populous group, non-Hispanic Whites, have proportionally declined from 87.6% in 1970 while Hispanic or Latino increased from 4.6% to 31.5% from 1970.</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;">According to a 2004 study, Las Vegas has one of the highest divorce rates, not wholly due to the Las Vegas themselves getting divorced but more because divorce is easier in Nevada than most other states &ndash; many people therefore go there for easier process. Similarly, Nevada marriages a notoriously easy to get. Las Vegas has one of the highest marriage rates of U.S cities, with many licenses issued to people from outside the area.</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>4. Fun Facts &amp; Figures</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Most of Vegas&rsquo;s iconic hotels aren&rsquo;t technically located in the city of Las Vegas. A good portion of the Las Vegas Strip &ndash; and the famed &ldquo;Welcome to Fabulous Las Vegas&rdquo; sign &ndash; are actually located in an unincorporated township called Paradise, Nevada.</li>\n<li>The strip&rsquo;s Flamingo Las Vegas Hotel and Casino got its name from founder &ndash; and legendary mobster &ndash; Bugsy Siegel&rsquo;s girlfriend. Actress Virginia Hill went by the nickname &ldquo;The Flamingo&rdquo; because of her red hair and long, thin legs.</li>\n<li>Vegas Vic &ndash; the oversized neon cowboy that presides over downtown&rsquo;s famed Fremont Street &ndash; it&rsquo;s the largest mechanical neon sign in the world.</li>\n<li>More than 41 million visitors cycle through Sin City each year, which might explain why the town boasts 14 of the world&rsquo;s 20 biggest hotels.</li>\n<li>There&rsquo;s a secret city underneath the city. Miles of tunnels &ndash; originally built to protect the desert town from flash floods.</li>\n<li>In May 1955, the Moulin Rouge made history when it became the city&rsquo;s first interracial casino. Legendary boxer Joe Louis, a part owner, declared &ldquo;This isn&rsquo;t the opening of a Las Vegas hotel. It&rsquo;s history.&rdquo;</li>\n<li>It takes roughly 10 minutes to nab a marriage license at the bureau in downtown Las Vegas, which is open every day from 8am until midnight. No wonder some 10,000 couples wed in the city each month.</li>\n<li>The half-scale model of the Eiffel Tower, located outside Paris Las Vegas, was originally planned to be full-size, but due to the close proximity of the airport- just three miles &ndash; it had to be shrunk down. In contrast, the Luxor Las Vegas&rsquo;s Sphinx is actually larger than the original Great Sphinx of Giza.</li>\n<li>At 50 tons, the bronze lion outside the MGM Grand Hotel is believed to be the largest bronze sculpture in the western hemisphere.</li>\n<li>The distinctive gold colour of the windows at the Mirage Hotel comes from actual gold dust.</li>\n<li>Before his death in 2009, Michael Jackson was looking into doing a Vegas residency. He planned to advertise it with a 50-foot robot-likeness of himself that would roam the Nevada desert.</li>\n<li>From outer space, the Las Vegas Strip appears as the brightest spot on Earth.</li>\n</ul>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>5. Weather</strong></p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Las Vegas&rsquo;s climate is a subtropical, hot desert climate, typical of the Mojave Desert in which it lies. The city enjoys abundant sunshine year-round; it has an average of about 310 sunny days per year. It is virtually free of tornadoes and ice storms.</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The summer months of June through September are very hot and mostly dry, with a daily average temperature of 92.5 ᵒF (33.6 ᵒC), while night time temperatures often remain above 80 ᵒF (27 ᵒC). &nbsp;Humidity is very low and often under 10%.</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Winer is short and the season in generally mild. December is the coolest month with temperature falls to 47.7 ᵒF (8.7 ᵒC) on average. The mountains surrounding Las Vegas accumulate snow during the winter, but snow is rare in Las Vegas Valley itself.</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>6. Transportation</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Airport Shuttle: the most economical way to get to your hotel. Shuttles can cost less than $10 for Strip/Downtown. Check with your hotel for schedules.</li>\n<li>Car Rentals: The average price for an economy car in Vegas is around $25 to $30 per day, but there are variety ranges of price on different cars to suit your personal reference.</li>\n<li>Limousine Services: you can see Las Vegas in style for as low as $35 an hour. Options and pricing vary depending on the vehicle and services.</li>\n<li>Public Transportation (Regional Transportation Commission &ndash; RTC):\n<ul>\n<li>Duece on the Strip: runs from the Fremont Street Experience in Downtown Las Vegas all the way to the Mandalay Bay, stopping at nearly every hotel along the day. Schedule frequency: every 15 minutes from 7am to 2am, and every 20 minutes from 2am to 7am.</li>\n<li>The Strip &amp; Downtown Express (SDX): connects Downtown Las Vegas, the Las Vegas Convention Center and the Las Vegas Strip with limited stops, getting you to your destination faster.

69	Gastronomy		\N	<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>1. Must-eat in Las Vegas</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>The riserva steak</strong>: Dry-aging is rightfully all the rage, but 60 days is for wusses. Carnevino does it the right way with the riserva&mdash;minimum <em>240-day</em> dry-aged steaks. The riserva displays the pungency of gorgonzola while conveying the essence of pure meat in every bite. After experiencing this, you&rsquo;ll never look at steak in the same way. (<em><u>Carnevino, at Palazzo, 789-4141</u></em><em>.)</em></li>\n<li><strong>Chicken fingers:</strong> Crispy, golden breading wraps impossibly moist chicken with wide bowls of hot sauce and ranch for dipping. (<em><u>Crown &amp; Anchor British Pub, 1350 E. Tropicana Ave., 739-8676; 4755 Spring Mountain Road, 876-4733</u></em><em>.</em><em>)</em></li>\n<li><strong>Hot N Juicy style shrimp</strong>: go with the shrimp Hot N Juicy style in a seasoning mix that combines all the other flavors for a garlicky, Cajun kick that will have you licking your fingers long after the last crustacean has disappeared into your belly. (<em><u>Hot N Juicy Crawfish, 4810 Spring Mountain Road, Suite C-D, 891-8889; 3863 Spring Mountain Road, 750-2428.</u></em><em><u>)</u></em></li>\n<li><em><strong>Consome loco and cochinita pibil tacos:</strong></em> <em>this authentic Mexican food, which is a </em>crazy-good chicken soup with rice, avocado and lime that&rsquo;s as comforting as anything your mother makes. Follow it with a pair of <em>cochinita pibil</em> tacos, spicy pork cooked in banana leaves and topped with pickled onions. (<em><u>Los Antojos, 2520 S. Eastern Ave., #B, 457-3505</u></em><em>.</em><em>)</em></li>\n<li><em><strong>Khao soi</strong></em><em>: </em>Coconut cream curry packs a sweet, mellow heat over egg noodles and your protein of choice, garnished with red onion, lime and pickled vegetables for some essential balance. (<em><u>Lotus of Siam, 953 E. Sahara Avenue #A5, 735-3033.</u></em><em><u>)</u></em></li>\n<li><em><strong>Honey toast</strong></em><em>: </em>a loaf of chewy white bread with the top lopped off, baked till the crust is crisp with butter and honey melted into its gooey center then topped with heavy scoops of vanilla ice cream. It&rsquo;s hot and cold, salty and sweet&mdash;the kind of simple, gratifying dessert that lingers long after you&rsquo;ve put down the spoon. (<em><u>Ichiza, 4355 Spring Mountain Road, 367-3151</u></em><em>.</em><em>)</em></li>\n<li><em><strong>Chicken fried lobster</strong></em><em>: </em>a large piece of lobster tail, breaded and fried, can hold its own with any steak or prime rib in the place. Along with a baked potato and the rest of the fixins, you&rsquo;ll be lucky if you can finish the whole meal. (<em><u>Binion&rsquo;s Ranch Steak House, at Binion&rsquo;s, 382-1600</u></em><em>.</em><em>)</em></li>\n</ul>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>2. Iconic Restaurants:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><em><strong>Michael&rsquo;s Gourmet Room:</strong></em> The best kept fine dining secret in Las Vegas, Michael&rsquo;s is super old school, with tuxedoed waiters and captains doing tableside presentations like deboning Dover Sole and igniting bananas Foster flamb&eacute;, while serving up hard to find forgotten classics like veal saltimbocca and Coquille St. Jacques &ndash; even the signature sorbet intermezzo is topped with Dom Perignon. Michael&rsquo;s has been doing its thing since 1979, and was the anchor for the late Barbary Coast Casino. It was relocated along with its most famous fixtures, an enormous entry door, the Tiffany glass domed ceiling, and its career waiters, to the South Point Resort, a large casino hotel catering mainly to locals and equestrians a few miles south of Mandalay Bay on Las Vegas Boulevard. It seats just 50 in plush banquets, dinner only, and to step in is to renter the city&rsquo;s Golden Age &ndash; it is absolutely worth the trip, though very expensive.</li>\n<li><strong>Sterling Brunch</strong>: always voted the city&rsquo;s best. it is one of the few &ldquo;champagne&rdquo; brunches in the country actually serving real champagne, Perrier-Jouet, unlimited and poured generously by excellent wait staff, along with bottomless mimosas and Bloody Mary&rsquo;s. The food signatures are whole lobster tails with drawn butter, the caviar station, and the raw bar with fresh shucked oysters. There is a lot more too, from Stone crab claws to rack of lamb, dim sum station, sushi station, hand carved meats and made to order desserts including crepes, all in an elegant setting. Anything that takes time, like eggs or desserts cooked to order, is delivered to your table, a really nice touch. Lots of brunch buffets boast omelette stations but how many serve up a house specialty omelette of lobster, cognac and boursin cheese?</li>\n<li><em><strong>Du-par&rsquo;s</strong></em><em>: </em>Most locals actually flock to this 24-hour coffee shop in the Golden Gate hotel downtown for its famously beloved pancakes, perennially rated the best in town, along with a vast slate of homemade pies. In true diner style, it has a huge menu, from breakfast to blue plate lunches to all sorts of dinner entrees, and a bakery list that goes on and on, but its classic status comes from one singular item, the shrimp cocktail. The Golden Gate was Las Vegas&rsquo; very first hotel (different name in 1906), and was assigned the first telephone number in Las Vegas (simply 1), sits at One Fremont Street, and among its many historic firsts was the 50-cent shrimp cocktail, launched in 1961 as part of a San Francisco/Fisherman&rsquo;s Wharf rebranding theme.</li>\n<li><strong>The Golden Steer</strong>: has been the place for beef since 1958, serving big steaks with classic steakhouse starters and sides like jumbo shrimp cocktail, crab cakes and hash browns, the place has a decidedly local, neighbourhood tavern feel, especially in its incongruously downscale bar room, complete with video poker. The Golden Steer is a high-end steakhouse, and not cheap, but noticeably less expensive than its Strip hotel and celebrity chef competitors.</li>\n<li><strong>Hugo&rsquo;s Cellar</strong>: sits in the bottom of the otherwise easy to overlook Four Queens casino in old Downtown. Its signature is a huge salad cart wheeled to the table where your salad is theatrically assembled to order. It has a more traditionally Continental style than the steak-centric Top of Binion&rsquo;s Steakhouse, another classic just down the street, with forgotten dishes like duck flamb&eacute; and seafood en papillote. There&rsquo;s a cozy cocktail lounge where they serve pate and crackers, nothing has changed here in forever, and locals pack the place, especially on weekends.</li>\n<li><strong>Top of Binion&rsquo;s Steakhouse:</strong> It is home to another old school classic steakhouse, predating the moon landing (and relocated within Binion&rsquo;s in 1994), on the top floor, reached by private elevator and boasting great views of Fremont Street. The menu is simple, with sides like iceberg wedge salad and creamed spinach anchoring a list of 28-day dry aged, grass-fed, corn-finished steaks, but there is a notable exception that puts the place on the map &ndash; the legendary one of a kind signature dish, Chicken Fried Lobster. Developed as a special dish for country music star Merle Haggard, it gained a cult reputation among cowboys visiting for the Rodeo world championships, and is now a staple. A large whole lobster tail is shelled, flattened, dredged in milk and flour, and then of course deep fried.</li>\n<li><strong>Peppermill</strong>: it is one of very few old freestanding restaurants on the Strip, not associated with any casino, and its past clientele is a Vegas Who&rsquo;s Who that includes Frank Sinatra and Jerry Lewis. It is within Vegas icons, where regulars and tourists flock side by side. This true classic has so much frozen in time atmosphere it has been used in many movies and television shows, from <em>Casino</em> to <em>CSI</em><em>.</em></li>\n<li><strong>Chicago Joe&rsquo;s:</strong> serving big portions of its hearty fare to deeply loyal local fans at very reasonable prices. Think linguine with clam sauce, spaghetti and meatballs, and eggplant, shrimp or chicken parmesan, all accompanied by rolls and a simple house salad with creamy Caesar.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Reference:</em></p>\n<p><a href="http://www.lasvegas.com">http://www.lasvegas.com</a></p>	LINQ_Promenade.jpg	\N	\N	on	1	2017-02-12 23:50:28.227847+00	2017-02-12 23:50:28.227847+00	36	3

Coral reefs not only support a vast array of marine organisms, but also help provide natural protective barriers that guard against coastal erosion. However, these stony natural wonders are undergoing numerous threats, including bleaching, disease and invasive predators. Reduced growth and death of coral reefs are often the result of coastal development, changing climate, and acidification of the ocean&rsquo;s delicate chemistry.

Wonderworks began as a Top Secret research laboratory, led by Professor Wonder, on a remote island in the Bermuda Triangle. During an experiment gone awry, a manmade tornado unleashed through the laboratory and created a swirling vortex that carried the building thousands of miles away, landing it upside-down on top of a brick warehouse on International Drive in Orlando, Florida. Remarkably, all of the experiments remained intact and functional. Once inside, you will be able to explore six Wonder Zones: Natural Disasters, Physical Challenges, Light and Sound, Imagination Lab, Space Discovery and the Far Out Art Gallery.</p>\n<p>Reference:</p>\n<p><a href="http://www.visitorlando.com">http://www.visitorlando.com</a></p>	Discovery Cove.jpg	\N	\N	on	1	2017-02-13 00:40:56.72519+00	2017-02-13 00:40:56.72519+00	40	2
88	Attractions		\N	<ol>\n<li><strong>Hanauma Bay</strong> &ndash; one of the most famous places on the entire island for snorkeling. Hanauma Bay is located on the very east side of Honolulu, near an area of town called Hawaii Kai. The bay, sunken into a crater with a gorgeous stretch of golden sand, is a nature reserve and marine sanctuary. Hanauma is one of the most popular tourist destinations on the Island and has suffered somewhat from overuse (at one time accommodating over three million visitors per year). In 1956, dynamite was used to clear portions of the reef to make room for telephone cables linking Hawaii to the west coast of the US.<br />Snorkeling is the most popular activity on Hanauma Bay. Swimming just above the coral rocks and spotting amazing sea creatures is a relaxing and enjoyable way to spend the day on the island of Oahu. There is at least one company on the beach that rents snorkeling equipment and provides lessons for beginners. Even the most inexperienced snorkeler can have a great time swimming with the Hawaiian wildlife in Hanauma Bay.</li>\n</ol>\n<ol start="2">\n<li><strong>Diamond Head</strong> - the iconic former volcano that stands proud at the far eastern side of Waikiki, and is often an emblem of visiting Honolulu. The volcano provides a great backdrop to all your beach photos from Waikiki, but the view is even better when you&rsquo;re on the very top of it.<br />The Diamond Head crater was formerly used as military base on Oahu, but is now open to the public for recreational use. The hike is just under a mile in length, and takes about 20 &ndash; 30 minutes to reach the summit. At first the trail is easy, then you come to a series of switchbacks where you start gaining elevation, and finally towards the end, you pass through a military tunnel, go up a few flights of stairs, and emerge through a bunker.</li>\n</ol>\n<ol start="3">\n<li><strong>Honolulu Zoo</strong> &ndash; located on the east side of Waikiki, the Honolulu Zoo is the only zoo within a radius of 2,392 miles. It is also the only zoo in the United States that originated in a King&rsquo;s grant of royal lands to the people. The 300 acre parcel was primarily a marshland of old fish ponds, lagoons and islands. In 1877, it was officially opened as Queen Kapiolani Park. Appointed Park Association members developed the unpromising land with the help of royal subsidies to display the King&rsquo;s private bird collection and to feature a horseracing track.<br />The modern Honolulu Zoo originated in 1984, when a second Master Plan was developed for a Tropical Zoological Garden. It organized all exhibits into three tropical ecological zones: the African Savanna, Asian and American Tropical Forests, and Pacific Islands. The zoo is spread out over 42 acres and is home to 905 different animals, most of the them natives of tropical climates. Don&rsquo;t miss the komodo dragon or the orangutan!<br />Along with the diversity of different animals at the Honolulu Zoo, the grounds are also neatly designed with many different lush tropical gardens, showcasing a variety of native Hawaiian plants and flowers.</li>\n</ol>\n<ol start="4">\n<li><strong>Waikiki Aquarium</strong> - Founded in 1904 and administered by the University of Hawaii since 1919, the Waikiki Aquarium is located on the shoreline of Waikiki Beach next to a living reef and across from Kapiolani Park.

The building has been restored to its former glory and is a great place to experience Hawaiian history. The palace was the residence of Hawaii's royalty until they were deposed by American settlers in 1893. It then served as the state capitol until the modern one was constructed in 1969. The palace was restored in the 1970s and opened as a museum in 1978. The interior boasts elaborate wood paneling and carving of native woods like Koa and several imported species. The throne room still has the original carved throne and chandelier. Stained glass and elaborate decorations grace the fa&ccedil;ade.<br />Located in the palace grounds are the Royal Barracks where the king's bodyguards lived. Originally built in 1871 close to the site of the present Hawaii State Capitol, the barracks only moved to their current position when the Capitol was built. The building resembles medieval battlements with embrasures, which appear somewhat odd in these surroundings. The palace is listed on the National Register of Historic Places</li>\n</ol>\n<ol start="6">\n<li><strong>Manoa Falls &amp; Lyon Arboretum</strong> &ndash; is a waterfall located in the Manoa Valley in Honolulu. The Manoa Falls is 150-foot waterfall that empties into a small pool of water.

It is said to have one of largest collection of palms found in a botanical garden. This facility is also an active research facility, working on preserving the state's tropical forests. The Arboretum maintains a number of theme gardens that visitors can easily wander through. Among these are an herb and spice garden, bromeliad garden, the Beatrice H. Krauss Hawaiian Ethnobotanical Garden, and many others. The facility is both beautiful and educational.</li>\n</ol>\n<ol start="7">\n<li><strong>Waikiki </strong>- Located on the south shore of&nbsp;<a href="http://www.gohawaii.com/oahu/regions-neighborhoods/honolulu/">Honolulu</a>, the world-famous neighborhood of Waikiki was once a playground for Hawaiian royalty.

On these famous shores, the past and the future are uniting in fresh and surprising ways.</li>\n</ol>\n<ol start="8">\n<li><strong>Pearl Harbor, USS Arizona</strong> - not so much an attraction in Honolulu, but rather a memorial. It was on the morning of December 7th, 1941, when Japanese aircraft made a surprise bomb attack on the US ships anchored in Honolulu&rsquo;s Pearl Harbor. During the deadly attack, many lives were lost, and many ships were destroyed. It was after this attack, when the US declared war on Japan and entered into World War II.<br />When you arrive at Pearl Harbor and the USS Arizona Memorial, you get a ticket with a time on it. When it&rsquo;s your turn, you meet your group and first watch a 30 minutes&rsquo; film which explains the history of what happened at Pearl Harbor.<br />After the film, you board a ferry for a short 5 minutes&rsquo; ferry ride to the USS Arizona Memorial, which is a white platform that floats above the sunken ship. You spend about 15 minutes on the platform, respecting the location and the events that happened right there years ago.</li>\n</ol>\n<ol start="9">\n<li><strong>Queen Emma Summer Palace</strong> - The white colonial mansion, built in 1848, was a summer home for King Kamehameha IV and Queen Emma. The museum contains koa furniture and quilts as well as Emma's wedding dress.<br />The house consists of six rooms, with the one across the back added in 1865 to accommodate the Duke of Edinburgh during his visit. The room's highlight is a Gothic curved glass cabinet given by Queen Victoria for the wedding of the royal couple. It was made in Germany from Koa logs shipped from Hawaii.<br />The front parlour room has a round dining table in an early mission style and is one of the only pieces remaining from John Young II, a missionary who built the house and left it to Queen Emma. The 1865 baby grand piano was picked up on the royal family's grand tour of Europe. The rosewood bookcases display symbols of royalty such as a woman's feather cape and a chief's helmet made of roots. The front bedroom across the hall contains an 1842 four-poster bed made of Koa wood, a sleigh bed with a crown, and a cradle in the shape of a canoe decorated with shells. Three rooms across the middle of the house display Hawaiian feather capes, one of which contains 100,000 feathers, wooden bowls, glass, silver, jewellery, and tapa cloths. The house has been a museum since 1913 and is operated by the Daughters of Hawaii. While the King and Queen had six houses, this is one of only two which remain standing.</li>\n</ol>\n<ol start="10">\n<li><strong>Foster Botanical Garden</strong> &ndash; established in 1853, it is the oldest botanical garden in Hawaii.

87	General Information		\N	<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>1. Introduction</strong></p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Located on the island of Oahu&rsquo;s south sore, Honolulu is the vibrant epicenter of Hawaii. This capital and largest city of Hawaii is where you&rsquo;ll find everything from historic landmarks, treasured monuments to flourishing arts, and cultural scene. Moreover, from the nightlife, live music and fine dining of Waikiki to the art galleries and underground bars, to Hawaii&rsquo;s finest museums or finest Hawaii Regional Cuisine chef, the best resorts, festivals, and events; being in Honolulu is no doubt a guarantee to one of the best holidays you&rsquo;ll experience.</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>2. History of Foundation</strong></p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The name Honolulu means &ldquo;sheltered bay&rdquo; or &ldquo;peace of shelter&rdquo; in Hawaiian, and its natural harbor catapulted this humble village to importance in 1809, shortly after King Kamehameta I conquered Oahu in order to unite the Hawaiian Islands under the Kingdom of Hawaii, that he moved his royal court form the island of Hawaii to Oahu.&nbsp;</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Honolulu's ideally located port made the city a perfect stop for merchant ships traveling between North America and Asia, and through the 1800s, descendants of missionaries who arrived in the early 1800s established their headquarters in Honolulu, making it the centre of business and the main seaport for the Hawaiian Islands.</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The late 1800s and early 1900s brought the overthrow of the Hawaiian monarchy and subsequent annexation by the United States. Under American rule, Honolulu saw the rise of tourism and the first hotels were constructed in Waikiki. American rule also brought the U.S. military, which built numerous bases in the islands, not least of which was nearby Pearl Harbor; now famous for the surprise attack by the Japanese in 1941, which brought the U.S. into World War II in the Pacific.</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Statehood for the islands brought rapid economic growth to Honolulu, with all the state's major businesses headquartered in the city, the Honolulu airport as the primary entrance point for visitors, and Waikiki as the centre of the island's tourism industry. Statehood for the islands brought rapid economic growth to Honolulu, with all the state's major businesses headquartered in the city, the Honolulu airport as the primary entrance point for visitors, and Waikiki as the centre of the island's tourism industry.</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>3. Area &amp; Population</strong></p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Honolulu is the most remote city of its size in the world and is both the westernmost and southernmost major U.S city. According to the United States Census Bureau, the total area of Honolulu is 68.4 square miles ((177.2&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>). 60.5 square miles (156.7&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>) of it (88.44%) is land, and 7.9 square miles (20.5&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>) of it (11.56%) is water. The closest location on the mainland to Honolulu is the Point Arena Lighthouse in California, at 2,045 nautical miles (3,787&nbsp;km). However, part of the Aleutian Islands of Alaska are slightly closer to Honolulu than the mainland.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Downtown Honolulu &ndash; the financial, commercial, and government centre of Hawaii. One of the waterfront is Aloha Tower, which for many years was the tallest building in Hawaii. Currently, the tallest building is the 438ft (134m) tall First Hawaiian Center, located on King and Bishop Streets.</li>\n<li>The Arts District Honolulu &ndash; in downtown/Chinatown is on the eastern edge of Chinatown. It is a 12-block area bounded by Bethel &amp; Smith Streets and Nimitz Highway and Beretania Street &ndash; home to numerous arts and cultural institutions. It is located within the Chinatown Historic District, which includes the former Hotel Street Vice District</li>\n<li>The Capitol District is the eastern part of Downtown Honolulu. It is the current and historic centre of Hawaii&rsquo;s state government, incorporating the Hawaii State Capitol, &lsquo;Iolani Palace, Honolulu Hale (City Hall), State Library, and the statue of King Kamehameha I, along with numerous government buildings.</li>\n<li>Ala Moana is a district between Kaka&rsquo;ako and Waikiki and the home of Ala Moana Center, the &ldquo;World&rsquo;s largest open air shopping center&rdquo; and the largest shopping mall in Hawaii.</li>\n<li>Waikiki is the tourist district of Honolulu, located between the Ala Wai Canal and the Pacific Ocean next to Diamond Head.

Facts &amp; Figures</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Honolulu is the only city in the United States that is home to a royal palace.</li>\n<li>More than 100 beaches surround Honolulu, more than almost any other city in the world.</li>\n<li>Clearly Honolulu wants its residents to have a good time because you can be fined for NOT owning a boat.</li>\n<li>We can all thank Honolulu for Casual Friday. Back in the 1970s, clothing companies in Honolulu convinced executives to allow employees to dress down so they could sell clothes. The relaxed dress code then circled around the rest of the country.</li>\n<li>Nicole Kidman, the infamous Australian actress was actually born in Honolulu. The city is also the hometown to actresses Shannyn Sossamon and Lauren Graham, Hollywood icon Bette Midler, and former Pussycat Doll Nicole Scherzinger.</li>\n<li>The Honolulu fish auction, modeled after Tokyo&rsquo;s Tsukji&rsquo;s fish market, is the only live tuna auction of its kind in the entire United States.</li>\n<li>You&rsquo;ll be able to see gorgeous vistas without advertising interruptions because billboards are outlawed in Honolulu.</li>\n<li>The famous Naval Station Pearl Harbor is adjacent to Honolulu and is probably best known for the attacks on it to start World War II.

According to Hawaii&rsquo;s constitution, any island not named to a county, is considered part of Honolulu, making the city 1,500 miles long. For those keeping count, that&rsquo;s halfway across the whole contiguous United States.</li>\n<li>The Aloha Festival in Honolulu began as a local celebration, but it has expanded to a week-long tribute to Hawaiian heritage, that includes the crowning of the royal court.</li>\n</ul>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>5. Weather</strong></p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Honolulu experiences a hot semi-arid climate with a mostly dry summer season, due to a rain shadow effect.

Transportation</strong></p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Unlike many cities on the U.S. mainland, Honolulu is not laid out in a strict compass-point grid.

Famous Bars &amp; Lounges:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Bleau Bar</strong>: This is the signature bar at the legendary resort where James Bond and Goldfinger played a game of gin rummy, where Frank and The Rat Pack played and where Elvis was really &ldquo;in the building.&rdquo; This iconic playground to the stars is back and more alluring than ever.

61	Gastronomy		\N	<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>1. Must-eat in Miami</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Arepas:</strong> think a flattened, pancake like grilled cheese and add some Colombian and Venezuelan flare. Arepas are made with a maize-like dough, stuffed with cheese, most commonly, and cooked until the dough reaches a golden brown. (at <em><u>La Latina Miami - 3509 NE 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33137</u></em>)</li>\n<li><strong>Biskits</strong>: a honey, apple cider glaze and a dash of Maldon. (at <em><u>The Fed - 5132 Biscayne Blvd, FL 33137</u></em>)</li>\n<li><strong>Caf&eacute; con Leche y Tostada Cubana</strong>: Nothing gets more simple, or classic, than cafe con leche and grilled bread. Similar to a cafe latte, the brew is instead made with Cuban coffee, an intense dose of espresso with what will seem like equal parts sugar. The buttered, Cuban bread can then be eaten alongside or dunked in the coffee to for a sweet and creamy pick-me up. (at <em><u>David&rsquo;s Caf&eacute; - 8718 SW 40th St, Miami, FL 33165</u></em>)</li>\n<li><strong>Ceviche</strong>: One of the most versatile dishes, ceviche consists of three parts: fish, acid, spice. Anything else is strictly embellishment. This Peruvian dish has been transformed into an American staple and is a must have for every menu card along a coastline. It's as classic Miami as white linen pants. (at <em><u>My Ceviche Brickell - 1250 S Miami Ave, Miami, FL 33130</u></em>)</li>\n<li><strong>Croquetas</strong>: Ham, cheese, chorizo, and chicken can all be found stuffed within Miami's best croquetas. Technically anything that is a minced or smashed into a small disk or cylinder then breaded and fried is a croqueta. Surprisingly enough, this includes crab cakes and mozzarella sticks. In Miami, you can find them in restaurants and bakeries just as often as you can along boardwalks.</li>\n<li><strong>Cuban Mojo</strong>: In Miami, Cuban mojo is on piled on everything. Most commonly made with garlic, sour orange juice, and occasionally olive oil, the sauce can act as a marinade for&nbsp;barbecuing or even a condiment in sandwiches that adds a zesty, garlic kick.</li>\n<li><strong>Cuban Sandwich</strong>: Miami&rsquo;s most iconic dish. A true collaboration between Cuban migrant workers and Floridians in the late 1800s and the early 20th century, this spin on the old ham and cheese is most often found simply with fresh Cuban bread, yellow mustard, roasted pork, baked ham, Swiss cheese, and sliced dill pickles.&nbsp;(at <em><u>Versailles Restaurant - 3555 SW 8th St, Miami, FL 33135</u></em>)</li>\n<li><strong>Deviled Eggs</strong>: a perfect snack menu item that takes a boring hard-boiled egg up several notches and transforms it into a delicious and delicate dish. The precisely cooked egg yolk is removed from the egg white and classically mixed with mayonnaise, Dijon mustard, lemon juice, and a touch of hot sauce. Once the mixture is complete, it is pipetted back into the egg white &lsquo;casing,&rsquo; ready to be served. (at <em><u>Michael&rsquo;s Genuine Food &amp; Drink - 130 NE 40th St, Miami, FL 33137</u></em>)</li>\n<li><strong>Fritas</strong>: a Cuban take on burger that has national appeal. A little spiced, ground beef, a little mojo, a few onions, and some shoestring potatoes, you have a frita. If it's a good enough grab for Obama while visiting the Magic City, then it's a good enough grab for you. (<em><u>at El Mago de las Fritas - 5828 SW 8th St, West Miami, FL 33144</u></em>)</li>\n<li><strong>Mofongo</strong>: a Puerto Rican speciality that is as beloved in Miami as it is in its hometown, featuring a small mountain made of fried plantains, garlic, and chicharrones that have all been smashed and molded together in a wooden mortar and pestle known as a pilon. Different variations can be made by adding seafood, chicken, pork, or broth.</li>\n<li><strong>Stone Crab Claws</strong>: Served cracked and chilled on ice, Florida Stone Crab claws can vary in size between 2.75 inches length to over a colossal 2 pounds. The&nbsp;sweet, lobster-esque meat needs little seasoning, yet is still&nbsp;classically served with hash browns, cole slaw, lemon, and mayo, butter, or tartar sauce. (at <em><u>Joe&rsquo;s Stone Crab - 11 Washington Ave, Miami Beach, FL 33139</u></em>)</li>\n</ul>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>2.

254	Spa & Wellness		\N	<p><strong>Mandara Spa at Walt Disney World Resort (1500 Epcot Resorts Blvd, Orlando, FL 32836)</strong>: Welcome to Bali by way of the Sunshine State. Mandara, known throughout the world for their soothing opulence, provides a quiet respite for meditation away from the chaos (fun though it may be) of the theme-park capital. Indulge in sensory delights via facial, mani-pedi or signature massage with room for meditation in one of their lovely interior gardens. Also on tap, signature therapies such as the Elemis Tri-Enzyme Resurfacing Facial, Mandara Hot Stone Therapy, Elemis Aroma Spa Seaweed Massage and Ionithermie Cellulite Reduction Treatment. Though any of the above will prove useful in de-stressing after a few days of theme park madness, that last one might offer you a little leeway when it comes time to order dessert.</p>\n<p><strong>The Spa (2626 Edgewater Dr, Orlando, FL 32804)</strong>: From body scrubs to Brazilians, prenatal massage to mainstay mani-pedis, the Spa always gets it right, which is why they're consistently ranked among the locals' favorites. The massage menu includes aromatherapy, Swedish, hot river stone and reflexology, the latter concentrating on pressure points in your feet to promote circulation and healing.

Additionally, The Spa's location in fun and funky College Park gives visitors access to an area exploding with prime, local to-dos, which makes planning drinks, meals or shopping before or after your treatments a breeze.</p>\n<p><strong>Spa Orlando at Thornton Park (23 Summerlin Avenue, Orlando, FL 32801)</strong>: The cozy-quaint vibe of Orlando's Thornton Park neighborhood follows you right inside the Spa Orlando, where sumptuous treatments await your body and mind with minimal sting to your wallet region.

Clean and quiet confines and quality staffers (strong, soothing therapists' hands are a bonus) are the heart of the operation.

In fact, the entire Eforea Spa experience at the Hiton Orlando is one of bliss, whether you pop in for an unplanned pedicure or are going "full honeymoon" with the $425 Poolside Cabana Package &ndash; a daylong experience that includes two custom 50-minute massages &ndash; this is a place where we'd say memories are made .... except the excellent staffers here have a way of inducing relaxation-based amnesia. Better bring a friend and take selfies. You might think you were just having a wonderful dream.</p>\n<p><strong>Pia Esthetics &ndash; Day Spa (407 W Fairbanks Avenue, Winter Park, FL 32789)</strong>: A favorite of Orlando locals, Pia Esthetics Day Spa (a Florida-based operation with additional locations in Tampa and St. Petersburg) offers a diverse menu of services, from massages to makeup, manicures to microdermabrasion. Pia has won a couple of local "best of" awards in recent years for their waxing services (they specialize in Brazilian and Completely Bare) and is also popular for their gel manicures and pedicures using Shellac, OPI gel and Gelish products. Pia also features spray tanning by SunFX, which means you can go home with a guilt-free Florida tan your dermatologist will okay.</p>\n<p><strong>Woodhouse Day Spa (Dellagio Town Center, 8060 Via Dellagio Way #102, Orlando, Fl 32819)</strong>: The very first Woodhouse Day Spa opened just outside downtown Victoria in 2001 and since then its nimble fingers have worked their way across North America with much success.

Luxurious treatment rooms are inviting, couples&rsquo; offerings romantic and packages are available to help those in need weed through all the offerings to find the perfect respite for proper rejuvenation.</p>\n<p><strong>Mokara Spa Orlando (Omni Orlando Resort at ChampionasGate, 1500 Masters Blvd, Championsgate, FL 33896)</strong>: Mokara recently ranked among Conde Nast Traveler's top 10 Spa Hotels in North America and its installation at the Omni Orlando Resort at ChampionsGate will do wonders for your golf game, whether that means a pre-tee off massage to limber you up or a post-play soak to soothe the sting of all those mulligans. This property is home to 36 holes' worth of serious championship play, so why not indulge with a sports massage. Designed to ease areas of muscle tension and soreness with a variety of techniques, this massage helps increase range of motion and flexibility. That can't hurt when you're on the par-4 14th hole of ChampionsGate's International course.</p>\n<p><strong>Eden Spa (2501 N Orange Avenue #186, Orlando, FL 32804)</strong>: Though this beautiful spa has been catering to the special needs of cancer patients since 2008, it welcomes everyone, making it an ideal place to bring a loved one whose body, mind and soul could really benefit from a menu of sumptuous treatments and state-of-the-art equipment, all of which is physician-approved. Treating the body along with the self-image is part of what makes Eden and its highly-trained therapists so effective, and whether that means something as ubiquitous as a mani-pedi or waxing or specialized, like lymphedema therapy or a boutique showcasing fashionable headwear, Eden delivers that priceless boost. Additionally, most of the products used here are either organic or vegan.</p>\n<p><strong>Waldorf Astoria Spa (Walt Disney World Resort, Waldorf Astoria Orlando, 14200 Bonnet Creek Resort Ln e, Orlando, FL 32821)</strong>: The Waldorf Astoria Spa by Guerlain is a 24,000-square foot facility that includes 22 treatment rooms. Body therapies, massages and other treatments geared toward rejuvenation, cleansing and overall well-being aid melt away the stress of the weary traveler and help leisure travelers sink deeper into the magnificent melt known as "vacation brain." Go a la carte or indulge in one of their half-day spa packages and if you're going to visit the expansive fitness center, or perhaps enjoy an hour-long yoga class, do so beforehand. Once you're appropriately tenderized you'll be better suited for a pre-dinner nap than a treadmill 5k.</p>\n<p><strong>The Spa at The Ritz-Carlton Orlando, Grande Lakes (4012 Central Florida Pkwy, Orlando, FL 32837)</strong>: Three levels. Forty treatment rooms. Forty-thousand square feet. Oh, and it's the Ritz-Carlton, so you know they pull out all the stops. Go alone or for a girls' or couple's day, begin in the co-ed relaxation room (where you can meet up and compare notes between treatments) or go whole-hog and get yourself a pampering cabana for poolside service by the outdoor, heated lap pool. The Spa Cafe, which you might hit up before, after or even in between treatments, strives for health and balance on its menu as much as its namesake. Well, except maybe the "Indulgence Burger," but spa means different things to different people and an hour-long foot massage definitely classifies as an indulgence.</p>	Everglades National Park.jpg	\N	\N	on	1	2017-04-20 03:12:52.807008+00	2017-04-20 03:12:52.807008+00	40	5

206	General Information		\N	<ol>\n<li><strong>Introduction</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Chicago is among the largest cities in the U.S. Famous for its bold architecture with a skyline punctuated by skyscrapers, museums dedicated to Impressionist and Post-Impressionist works of art. The city also known for having some of the best food, weekend events that include live music, theatre and comedy with energy and excitement all season. Chicago is built on the shores of greatness and is one of the most visited cities that attract many people from other towns and over the world.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ol start="2">\n<li><strong>History of Foundation</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The largest city of the American Midwest, Chicago, Illinois, was founded in 1830 and quickly grew to become, as Carl Sandburg&rsquo;s 1916 poem put it, &ldquo;Hog Butcher, Tool Maker, Stacker of Wheat, Player with Railroads and Freight Handler to the Nation.&rdquo; Established as a water transit hub, the city evolved into an industrial metropolis, processing and transporting the raw materials of its vast hinterland.</p>\n<p>The name Chicago comes from a Miami Indian word for the wild leeks that grew on the bank of the short Chicago River. Over the centuries the Miami, Sauk, Fox and Potawatomi tribes all lived in the area. The 1673 Marquette and Jolliet expedition crossed the Great Portage between the Chicago River and the Illinois, 10 miles of flat, often waterlogged ground separating the two great water transit systems of North America, the Great Lakes and the Mississippi Valley.</p>\n<p>The first non-Indian to settle within Chicago&rsquo;s future boundaries was a Santo Domingan of mixed African and European ancestry, Jean Baptiste Point du Sable, who arrived around 1780. In 1803, the U.S. Army built Fort Dearborn on the south bank of the Chicago River. It was destroyed in an Indian raid in 1812 but rebuilt four years later.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The 1832 Black Hawk War ended the last Native American resistance in the area. Chicago was incorporated as a town in 1833 and as a city in 1837, when its population reached 4,000. In 1848 Chicago got its first telegraph and railroad. Two innovations&mdash;grain elevators and the Board of Trade&rsquo;s wheat grading standards&mdash;quickly transformed the way crops were sold. By 1854 the city was the world&rsquo;s largest grain port and had more than 30,000 residents, many of them European immigrants.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In October 1871, a fire destroyed one-third of Chicago and left more than 100,000 homeless. Its initial spark remains unknown (legends of Mrs. O&rsquo;Leary&rsquo;s lantern-kicking cow notwithstanding), but it was fuelled by drought, high winds and wooden buildings. The factories and railroads were largely spared, and the city rebuilt with astonishing speed.</p>\n<p>In the late 1800s Chicago grew as a national retail centre and produced a crop of brand-name business tycoons, including Philip Armour, George Pullman, Potter Palmer and Marshall Field. In 1885 Chicago gave the world its first skyscraper, the 10-story Home Insurance Building. In 1893, Chicago hosted the World&rsquo;s Columbian Exposition, which drew 20 million visitors to its &ldquo;White City&rdquo; of plaster Gilded Age buildings built on former bogland beside Chicago&rsquo;s south lakefront.</p>\n<p>The 1886 Haymarket affair, in which police fired on protesting workers (and, in the confusion following a fatal anarchist bombing, each other), ushered in an era of protest and reform for the multitudes of workers who kept Chicago&rsquo;s meatpacking, manufacturing and shipping industries running. In 1894, declining wages at the Pullman Palace Car Company factory triggered a crippling national rail union boycott. In 1906 journalist Upton Sinclair published &ldquo;The Jungle,&rdquo; a novel that exposed cruel and unsafe practices in the city&rsquo;s meatpacking industry.</p>\n<p>Nationwide social upheavals surrounding World War I brought many African-American migrants to Chicago from the South.</p>\n<p>Between 1950 and 1960 Chicago&rsquo;s population shrank for the first time in its history, as factory jobs levelled off and people moved to the suburbs. Poor neighbourhoods were razed and replaced with massive public housing that solved few of the problems of poverty and violence. Riots in 1968 gave vent to anger following the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr., a violent police response marred protests at the Democratic National Convention that year.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Despite the decrease in population, immigrants still flock to the &ldquo;windy city,&rdquo; though now from Asia and Latin America more than Europe. Chicago remains a centre of trade: Airports supplement the old rail and water transit hubs, and agricultural futures are traded electronically from the floor of its storied Mercantile Exchange.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ol start="3">\n<li><strong>Area &amp; Population</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Chicago is located in north-eastern Illinois on the southwestern shores of Lake Michigan. It is the principal city in the Chicago Metropolitan Area, situated in the Midwestern United States and the Great Lakes watersheds. The city lies besides huge freshwater Lake Michigan, and two rivers &ndash; the Chicago River in downtown and the Calumet River in the industrial far South Side &ndash; flow through Chicago.</p>\n<p>Major sections of the city include the central business district, called The Loop, and the North, the South, and West Sides. The three sides of the city are represented on the Flag of Chicago by three horizontal white stripes. The North Side is the most densely populated residential section of the city, and many high-rises are located on this side of the city along the lakefront. The South Side is the largest section of the city, encompassing roughly 60% if the city&rsquo;s land area, contains the University of Chicago and most of the facilities of the Port of Chicago.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Chicago&rsquo;s population is estimated around 2.7 million people. More than half the population of the state Illinois lives in the Chicago metropolitan area, making it one of the United States&rsquo; most densely populated major cities, and the largest city in the Great Lake Megalopolis. The racial composition of the city was 45% White ( 31.7% non-Hispanic whites), 32.9% Black of African American, 28.9% Hispanic or Latino, 5.5% Asian, 0.5% American Indian, the rest is other race or two or more races.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ol start="4">\n<li><strong>Facts &amp; Figures</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>The name Chicago comes from the Algonquin word &ldquo;Chicagou&rdquo; or &ldquo;Shikaakwa&rdquo;, which translates to &ldquo;onion field&rdquo; or &ldquo;wild garlic&rdquo;.</li>\n<li>The Field Museum owns the world&rsquo;s most complete Tyrannosaurus Rex skeleton. Its name is Sue.</li>\n<li>The Chicago River flows backward. In the late 19<sup>th</sup> century, a reversal technique was introduced&nbsp;for sanitation reasons to divert the sewage away from Lake Michigan&rsquo;s water supply. It reversed empty into Mississippi River instead of Lake Michigan. The reversal of the river was recognized as being the largest public earth-moving project ever completed. It was also acknowledged as a great engineering achievement.</li>\n<li>In 1927, Chicago bootlegger Al Capone made nearly $60 million selling illegal hooch.</li>\n<li>Even before Capone&rsquo;s activities, the city had a reputation for crime. In 1918, over 100 waiters were arrested for poisoning stingy tippers.</li>\n<li>In 1930, the Twinkie was invented in Chicago by Chicagoan Jimmy Dewar. The original Twinkie was filled with banana cream, but during WWII, bananas became scarce and vanilla replaced it.</li>\n<li>Rebuilding after the Great Chicago Fire of 1871 was swift and legendary &ndash; rubble and ash were pushed into the lake to make new neighbourhoods.</li>\n<li>When Bavarian Anton Feuchtwanger couldn&rsquo;t convince fairgoers to eat his sausages, he served them in a bun. The hot dog was born.</li>\n<li>Tall-building construction was invented in Chicago and the city is known as the &ldquo;Home of the Skyscraper&rdquo;. It currently has four of the country&rsquo;s ten tallest buildings.</li>\n<li>Daniel Hale Williams was one of the first black physicians in the city. By 1883, he graduated with a degree in medicine from Northwestern University. In 1893, he performed the nation&rsquo;s first open heart surgery in Chicago Provident Hospital.</li>\n<li>In 1937, Chicago became the first city to established a blood bank in the United States.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ol start="5">\n<li><strong>Weather </strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The city lies within the humid continental climate zone, and experiences four distinct seasons. Summers are warm to hot and often humid, with a July average of 75.8&nbsp;&deg;F (24.3&nbsp;&deg;C). In a normal summer, temperatures can exceed 90&nbsp;&deg;F (32&nbsp;&deg;C) as many as 21&nbsp;days. Winters are cold and snowy with few sunny days, and the normal January high is just below freezing. Spring and autumn are mild seasons with low humidity. Dew point temperatures in the summer range from 55.7&nbsp;&deg;F (13.2&nbsp;&deg;C) in June to 61.7&nbsp;&deg;F (16.5&nbsp;&deg;C) in July.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ol start="6">\n<li><strong>Transportation</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Chicago is a walking city with an easy-to-navigate downtown grid. Madison Street divides the city north and south, while State Street divides it east and west. The State/Maddison intersection marks the origin of Chicago&rsquo;s address grid system. Addresses are relative to the distance from that mark, with eight blocks to every mile. So an address of 3600 North Clark means that it is 36 blocks north of Maddison.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Metra Commuter Rail: connects outlying suburbs to downtown and is an easy way to get into the heart of the city fast.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>North/Northwwest:\n<ul>\n<li>Milwaukee District North (MD-N) to Fox Lake</li>\n<li>North Central Service (NCS) to Antioch</li>\n<li>Union Pacific North (UP-N) to Kenosha</li>\n<li>Union Pacific Northwest (UP-NW) to Havard/McHenry</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>South/Southwest:\n<ul>\n<li>Heritage Corridor (HC) to Joliet</li>\n<li>Metra Electric District (ME) to University Park</li>\n<li>Rock Island District (RI) to Joliet</li>\n<li>SouthWest Service (SWS) to Manhattan</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>West\n<ul>\n<li>BNSF Railway (BNSF) to Aurora</li>\n<li>Milwaukee District West (MD-W) to Elgin</li>\n<li>Union Pacific West (UP-W) to Elburn</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Water taxis: For fast, affordable and fun connection between Chicago&rsquo;s top tourist destinations, Chicago Water Taxi by Wendella Boats and Shoreline Water Taxi are the perfect combination of sightseeing and convenient transportation.

As you cruise past other tours, you can&rsquo;t help but feel like you&rsquo;re on the cool bus. The tour guide ribs unsuspecting passers-by and they taunt back&mdash;&rdquo;Hey, it&rsquo;s Brad Pitt!&rdquo;&mdash;while an encyclopedic collection of location-relevant TMZ clips roll across the screens. Featuring celebrities from Avril Lavigne to JFK, the TMZ tour does not discriminate. Much like the show and website, the tour ridicules celebrity culture as much as it enables it&mdash;behind every Britney Spears joke is the burning desire to spot her somewhere along the tour. Essentially, the experience provides three tours in one. The sightseeing aspect efficiently and lightheartedly covers the most notable stops in Hollywood, <a href="http://www.timeout.com/los-angeles/food-drink/best-restaurants-in-la-las-best-restaurants-in-west-hollywood">West Hollywood</a> and Beverly Hills. Additionally, it&rsquo;s a celebrity-hunting tour&mdash;the guides are armed with camera rigs to record fodder for TMZ&mdash;where success is never guaranteed. And it&rsquo;s an ode to founder Harvey Levin that takes a turn for the melodramatic in the recapping of the day TMZ broke the story of Michael Jackson&rsquo;s death. For those that haven&rsquo;t bought into the TMZ universe, the tour is still a legitimately entertaining experience, thanks to the easygoing tour guides and the atonal, irreverent videos that toe the line of decency.</p>	TMZ Tour.jpg	\N	\N	on	1	2017-01-16 03:10:07.067319+00	2017-01-16 03:10:07.067319+00	44	2

195	General Information		\N	<p><strong><span class="bold">1. Introduction</span></strong></p>\n<p>Washington DC has evolved into much more than the nation&rsquo;s capital, as the city is home to numerous monuments and memorials, eclectic neighbourhoods, as well as true local culinary.</p>\n<p><strong><span class="bold">2. History of Foundation</span></strong></p>\n<p>Founded on July 16, 1790, Washington, DC is unique among American cities because it was established by the Constitution of the United States to serve as the nation&rsquo;s capital. You can read the actual line at the National Archives. From its beginning, it has been embroiled in political manoeuvring, sectional conflicts and issues of race, national identity, compromise and, of course, power.<br />Like many decisions in American history, the location of the new city was to be a compromise: Alexander Hamilton and northern states wanted the new federal government to assume Revolutionary War debts, and Thomas Jefferson and southern states who wanted the capital placed in a location friendly to slave-holding agricultural interests.<br />President George Washington chose the exact site along the Potomac and Anacostia Rivers, and the city was officially founded in 1790 after both Maryland and Virginia ceded land to this new &ldquo;district,&rdquo; to be distinct and distinguished from the rest of the states. To design the city, he appointed Pierre Charles L&rsquo;Enfant, who presented a vision for a bold, modern city featuring grand boulevards (now the streets named for states) and ceremonial spaces reminiscent of another great world capital, L&rsquo;Enfant&rsquo;s native Paris. He planned a grid system, at which the centre would be the Capitol building.<br />The city only increased in size as a result of the Civil War. Slaves owned in Washington were emancipated on April 16, 1862, nine months before the Emancipation Proclamation, and it therefore became a hub for freed slaves. After, it remained a home to a significant and vibrant African American population, which included abolitionist Frederick Douglass. A substantial army was set up just to protect the capital during the war, and the federal government grew around this administration.<br />In 1901, the city proposed the McMillan Plan, which set out to fully complete L&rsquo;Enfant&rsquo;s original designs. This included a redesign and expansion of the National Mall, now the crown jewel of DC. The city continued to expand and develop during the rest of the 20th century, though it suffered riots and civil unrest in the &lsquo;60s and &lsquo;70s, and many residents left inner city areas for the suburbs. Today, these downtown areas are undergoing an urban renaissance, and many people are moving back into Washington itself.</p>\n<p><strong><span class="bold">3. Area &amp; Population</span></strong></p>\n<p>Washington, DC., is located in the mid-Atlantic region of the U.S East Coast. Due to the District of Columbia retrocession, the city has a total area of 68.34 square miles, of which 61.05 square miles is land and 7.29 square miles is water. The south bank of the Potomac River forms the District&rsquo;s border with Virginia and has two major tributaries: the Anacostia River and Rock Creek. The highest natural elevation in the District is 409 feet above sea level at Fort Reno park in upper northwest Washington. The lowest point is sea level at the Potomac River. The District has 7,464 acres of parkland, about 19% of the city&rsquo;s total area and the second-highest percentage among high-density U.S cities.</p>\n<p>The population is approximately 681, 170 in 2016, according to the U.S Census Bureau. The population of Washington DC was 48.3% Black of African American, 44.1% White (36.1% non-Hispanic White), 4.2% Asian, 0.6% American Indian or Alska Native, and 0.2% Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander.</p>\n<p><strong>4. Facts &amp; Figures</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Presidential Pastimes:\n<ul>\n<li>George Washington never lived in DC. The White House was completed a year after he died and the second U.S President, John Adams, was the first to live there.</li>\n<li>George Washington was supposed to be buried at the U.S Capitol but his will stated that he wanted to be buried at his home, Mount Vernon, just outside of DC in Virginia. You can visit his home and estate and pay respect.</li>\n<li>White House has a total of 35 bathrooms</li>\n<li>The original phone number of the White House in 1878 was simply the number 1. A phone wasn&rsquo;t installed on the President&rsquo;s desk in the Oval Office until 1929.</li>\n<li>When Abraham Lincoln stayed at the Soldier&rsquo;s Home during summers, he would often commute the four miles to and from the White House on horseback.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>First Animals\n<ul>\n<li>President Theodore Roosevelt allowed his six children to brings their pets to the White House in 1901, include dogs, a small bear, a lizard, guinea pigs, a pig, a badger, a blue macaw, a garter snake, a one-legged rooster, a hyena, a barn own, a rabbit, a pony and a Baron Spreckle the hen.</li>\n<li>Calvin Coolidge ( the 30th President) also brought many dog breeds including terriers, a sheepdog, collies and chows.

During WW1, Woodrow Wilson (the 28th President) bought a flock of sheep to graze on the White House lawn. Not only did it save the manpower needed for mowing the lawn, they also sold the wool to raise money for the Red Cross.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Monuments, Memorials, and Museums\n<ul>\n<li>When the Washington Monument opened in 1884, it was the tallest structure in the world, until the Eiffel Tower in Paris took the title in 1889.</li>\n<li>The DC War Memorial, which honors local residents of Washington D.C, is the only memorial dedicated to WW1 on the National Mall.</li>\n<li>The Library of Congress is the largest library in the world with more than 162 million objects in its collection.

There was no professional baseball in DC until 2005 when a team was moved to the city and adopted the name the Washington Nationals.</li>\n<li>The seventh inning stretch was started when President William Howard Taft (the 27th President) visited a game in Washington D.C and decided to stretch his legs in the seventh inning. Everybody assumed the president was getting up to leave so fans throughout the ballpark stood up as well out of respect, thus beginning the tradition of the seventh inning stretch.</li>\n<li>Stephen Strasburg holds the record for most strikeouts in a game by any Nationals pitcher since the franchise moved to DC, whiffing 14 Pittsburg Pirates in his professional debut on June 8, 2010.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Other fun facts\n<ul>\n<li>The Maine Avenue Fish Market has been operating nonstop since 1805, making it the oldest continuously functioning fish market in the country.</li>\n<li>The cherry blossom trees that line the Tidal Basin and have beautiful pink blooms every spring were a gift from the mayor of Tokyo in 1912.</li>\n<li>The Friendship Archway over H St. and 7th St. in Chinatown was built in 1986 to celebrate the friendship between Washington and sister city, Beijing, China.</li>\n<li>Georgetown is the oldest part of the city, dating back to 1751 &ndash; 40 years before Washington D.C was founded.</li>\n<li>D.C averages 39 inches of rainfall a year &ndash; more than Seattle!</li>\n<li>Washington D.C is a very international city, home to more than 175 embassies and international cultural centres, 15% of D.C residents speak a language other than English.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>5.

251	Spa & Wellness		\N	<p><strong>Amy Rae Aesthetic (7257 Beverly Blvd #110, LA, CA 90036)</strong>: opened this past spring, with a mind for holistic, organic treatments. It's a peaceful space with a lovely assortment of products, which are selected based on your individual skin and body concerns. This spa is best known for their facials, and one of the most popular treatments here is the Oxygen Facial with LED Light Therapy. Owner Amy Rae says this treatment is most favored by people with a looming special occasion in the next 72 hours or so&mdash;a wedding, or a stroll down a red carpet, perhaps. Other treatments include massage, acupuncture, allergy testing, and the spa also has an infrared sauna.</p>\n<p><strong>Wi Spa (2700 Wilshire Blvd, LA, CA 90057 &ndash; in Koreatown)</strong>: the longstanding, 48,000-square-foot, 24-hour Korean day spa located on Wilshire Boulevard.

Guests may linger in the Conservatory, decorated with peacock feathers and skylights that show a tropical scene, where mini-treatments are performed. For guests in between services, there&rsquo;s also a whirlpool, which can be found behind a shimmering curtain just inside the entrance to the locker rooms. Their Custom Blend Alchemy Bar allows guests to mix up their own lotions and scrubs using a variety of criteria, including health concerns, numerology and simple preferences. Treatments at all Burke Williams spas include the usual massages, pedicures and facials, though their new Ayurvedic treatments may be new to Americans: for instance, the Shirodhara involves continually pouring oil on the body for the duration of a light relaxation massage. It concludes with a steady oil flow on the forehead, which is believed to have a calming effect. For those suffering a bout of winter dryness, it&rsquo;s a warm and indulgent service that can be finished with a relaxing shower to rinse the oil from their hair and a blowout via the spa&rsquo;s blow-dry bar (available at the Hollywood and Woodland Hills locations).</p>\n<p><strong>Raven Spa (208 Pier Avenue, Santa Monica, CA 90405 or 2910 Rowena Ave, in Silverlake LA, CA 90039)</strong>: Departing from the more clinical decor of the hotel spas, Raven chooses to decorate with mismatched vintage furniture, chandeliers, mirrors and statues.

The Rock Star is a signature treatment and includes a lavender salt scrub, a traditional Thai massage and an organic yogurt oat mask. Tea and fruit is provided following treatment, and guests should note that a shower pass, which provides access their private steam showers, is an additional $5.

Their massages are simply priced ($90/80 minutes; $60/50 minutes; $33/25 minutes), and you can choose among add-ons like heat therapy, aromatherapy, crystal healing or deep tissue.

Though this indulgent spa can be pricey, they also occasionally do small soirees where guests can familiarize themselves with the spa by getting a complimentary mini-treatment plus refreshments, with optional add-on mini-treatments available for $25 each. They also offer quarterly wellness retreats and, depending on the season, you could follow up your spa day with a poolside cocktail at WP24's&nbsp;rooftop bar&nbsp;for one of the best views in L.A.</p>\n<p><strong>Peninsula Spa (9882 S Santa Monica Blvd, Beverly Hills, CA 90212)</strong>: Located inside the posh Peninsula Hotel in Beverly Hills, this sumptuous spa is for those who really want to splurge.

Unique treatments at this Beverly Hills spa include their gem stone series, which, yes, incorporate precious stones including rubies, emeralds and diamonds during massages and scrubs.

The spa is located next to the hotel's rooftop garden, where one might also enjoy lunch of a glass of wine.</p>\n<p><strong>Dtox Day Spa (3026 Los Feliz Blvd, LA, CA 90039)</strong>: DTox Day Spa in Atwater Village offers guests a variety of soothing treatments in their serene, candlelit treatment rooms, which can be followed or preceded by an unwind session in their relaxation room. It&rsquo;s quite pretty, with the ever-important white noise via twin waterfalls, and offers tea and snacks. Spa use is free with any 25-, 50- or 80-minute treatment, so plan extra time to use the sauna and steam rooms. (If you don&rsquo;t want a treatment, but do want to use the spa facilities, you may purchase a $30 day pass between 10 a.m. and 6 p.m. on weekdays only.) Locker rooms come fully stocked with robes, slippers and everything you need to get ready and return to the world.</p>\n<p><strong>RA Organic Spa (119 N San Fernando Blvd, Burbank, CA 91502)</strong>: This 4,000-square-foot spa can be found in downtown Burbank. They use products from Eminence Organics in their holistic treatments, including massages, facials, waxing, scrubs, and baths. Their baths are just that, though the water will be mixed with a variety of oils, flowers, milks and salts. Guests may enjoy fruit and tea in the serene waiting area, as well as the use of the spa's saunas and showers.</p>\n<p><strong>Blossom Spa (1354 Highland Ave, Hollywood, CA 90028)</strong>: It's odd to think that one of the most popular places to relax would be on Highland, just south of Sunset, but it's true. Blossom Spa is a cute and calming spa where treatments include a variety of massages, including prenatal and couples, facials, waxing and scrubs. For an additional $25, you will gain access to the Lotus Lounge, where you can unwind in front of a tiled fireplace with juice, tea, water, cheese and fruit. This is a great spot to disconnect if you're particularly frugal, as Blossom regularly offers very affordable specials (we've seen hour massages for as low as $49), so be sure to check their website for deals.</p>	Warner Bros Studio.jpg	\N	\N	on	1	2017-04-20 03:00:29.790624+00	2017-04-20 03:00:29.790624+00	37	5

As the long-time home of Chicago Shakespeare Theatre, there&rsquo;s always a chance to get your culture fix.</li>\n<li><strong>Grant Park</strong>: often referred to as Chicago&rsquo;s Front Yard. The tradition of Grant Park dates back to Chicago&rsquo;s inception &ndash; literally. In 1836, a year before Chicago was incorporated as a city, a note was found on a subdivision map declaring a patch of land along Lake Michigan, &ldquo;Public Ground &ndash; A common to Remain Forever Open, Clear and Free of any Buildings, or Other Obstruction whatever&rdquo;. The note became official when, in 1844, the city council make &ldquo;Lake Park&rdquo; an approved endorsement. After the Great Chicago Fire of 1871 greatly extended the land east of Michigan Avenue with landfill, the area between Randolph Street and Roosevelt Road became Grant Park. By 1901 it was a beautifully landscaped area of trees and public walkways developed on top of rubble left in the wake of the Great Chicago Fire.<br />Today, it's a beautiful stretch of land that separates commercial construction from the lakefront and a popular hub for Chicagoans and visitors. Combined with the city's storied architecture, Grant Park provides on-lookers with the most breath-taking skyline in the world.<br />With more than 300-acres of beautiful manicured green space, Grant Park is an inviting retreat nestled between the bustle of the city and the blue expanse of Lake Michigan. The park is studded with inspiring pieces of public artwork and sculptures.\n<ul>\n<li>Agora (2006): On the southwest side of Grant Park is&nbsp;<em>Agora</em>, one of Chicago's most recognizable and recent installations. Made up of 106 9-foot tall headless torsos made from cast iron, the sculpture is inspired by a Greek plaza but relates to bustling, high-paced Michigan Avenue. The figures are stationary but are posed in countless directions, symbolizing the idea of going everywhere and nowhere at once.</li>\n<li>Cloud Gate (2006): often referred to as &ldquo;The Bean&rdquo;, Anish Kapoor&rsquo;s Cloud Gate is shaped like a seamless curved oval and is made from highly polished stainless steel plates, providing a distorted reflection of the city skyline and gawking visitors. The 12-foot-high arch at the structures base provides a &ldquo;gate&rdquo; for park visitors to walk under.</li>\n<li>Jay Pritzker Pavilion (2004): Frank Gehry's one-of-a-kind, Deconstructivism styled performance stage is breath-taking. With its signature arched cage work and distinctive ornamentation, a New York Times reporter once described it as a "celestial gateway to another universe."&nbsp; The Jay Pritzker Pavilion delivers the ultimate outdoor event experience, so be sure to pack a picnic and catch annual celebrations here, such as the Grant Park Music Festival and the Millennium Park Summer Film Series, among many others.</li>\n<li>Crown Fountain (2004): Containing two 50-foot towers that project diverse facial images of Chicago citizens, the Crown Fountain is one of Chicago's most recognizable displays of public art. During summer days, visitors can cool off by wading in the structure's reflecting pool. Or, if they're daring enough, by taking a stroll under the fountain's cascading waterfall, which appears to come out of the faces' mouths.</li>\n<li>Christopher Columbus Monument (1933): Chicago celebrate its 100<sup>th</sup> birthday with the Century of Progress World&rsquo;s Fair in 1933. In cooperation with the event, Chicago&rsquo;s Italian-American community presented a towering bronze statue of explorer Christopher Columbus on the southern end of Grant Park.</li>\n<li>The Bowman and The Spearman (1928): Commemorating Native Americans and the tremendous challenges faced during the settlement of the United States, this dramatic duo of bronze sculptures in Congress Plaza Gardens depicts two muscular Native Americans on horseback, their bodies caught in action as one hurls a spear and the other releases an arrow from his bow-only, there's a catch: the weapons aren't shown. The bodies in movement and the intense gestures prompt viewers to fill in the blanks with their minds, as they imagine the spear vaulting forward and arrows whistling through the blue sky.</li>\n<li>Buckingham Fountain (1927): built to honour a former trustee at the Art Institute of Chicago, Clarence F. Buckingham Memorial Fountain contains four identical pairs of 20-foot bronze sea horses, symbolizing the four states bordering Lake Michigan. From April through mid-October, the fountain performs a dazzling water show for 20 minutes every hour, from 8 a.m.-11 p.m. Beginning at dusk, the water show also &nbsp;includes a light and music show.</li>\n<li>Seated Lincoln (1926): Abraham Lincoln was nominated to represent the Republican Party on the shores of the Chicago River, so it's only natural that the city honors our 16th President with a larger-than-life sculpture in Grant Park. Abraham Lincoln sits in a chair atop a granite pedestal symbolizing his being Head of State. The statue was the last public monument designed by Augustus Saint Gaudens. The artist did not live long enough to see the piece realized.&nbsp;</li>\n<li>The Spirit of Music (1923): To commemorate Theodore Thomas, the first conductor of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, is a bronze statue of the "Lady of Music." The statue personifies harmony and composition with a figure that is feminine and dignified, assertive and bold. The statue is accompanied by a gorgeous seasonal flower garden.</li>\n<li>Fountain of the Great Lakes (1913): An allegorical piece representing the five Great Lakes, this magnificent fountain in the South Garden of the Art Institute of Chicago consists of five bronze sculptures of women bathing with oversized seashells. The water flows through them in the order water flows through the lakes on its way to the ocean: Superior, Michigan, Huron, Erie and Ontario.</li>\n<li>General John Logan Memorial (1897): Logan was an Illinois based Civil War General and served as a State Senator from 1871-1877. Farmed sculptor August Saint-Gaudens built enormous animal sculptures for the Columbian Exposition and gifted this statue to Chicago in 1897.</li>\n<li>Lions at the Art Institute of Chicago (1893): Constructed by Edward Kemeys, these two massive bronze lions have been standing guard at the entrance to The Art Institute of Chicago since its inaugural year. While realistically designed, the green patina lends an artist flair and a distinctive appearance. During holidays and city events, the big cats are often decorated for the occasion.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>	Chicago-skyline-panorama.jpg	\N	\N	on	1	2017-03-17 03:44:35.157409+00	2017-03-17 03:44:35.157409+00	59	2

63	General Information		\N	<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>1. Introduction</strong></p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;">New Orleans is one of the world&rsquo;s most fascinating cities. It is home to a truly unique melting pot of culture, food and music. Moreover, New Orleans neighborhoods are where the culture and creativity of the Crescent City come to life. From the historic French Quarter to the elegant Garden District to the music-filled Marigny- there is great food, music and more to be found all across the city. Not only that, the city is also famous for its annual celebrations and festivals, most notably Mardi Gras, dating to French colonial times. Maybe that&rsquo;s why the New Orleans is often referred to as the &ldquo;most unique&rdquo; city in the United States.</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>2. History of Foundation</strong></p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Situated on a bend of the Mississippi River 100 miles from its mouth, New Orleans has been the chief city of Louisiana and the Gulf of Mexico&rsquo;s busiest northern port since the early 1700s. Founded by the French, ruled for 40 years by the Spanish and bought by the United States in the 1803 Louisiana Purchase, New Orleans is known for its distinct Creole culture and vibrant history.</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The first known residents of the New Orleans area were the Native Americans of the Woodland and Messapian cultures. The expeditions of De Soto (1542) and La Salle (1682) passed through the area, but there were few permanent white settlers before 1718, when the governor of French Louisiana, Jean-Baptiste Le Moyne, Sieur de Bienville, founded the city of Nouvelle-Orleans on the first crescent of high ground above the Mississippi&rsquo;s mouth. In 1722 he transferred Louisiana&rsquo;s capital from Biloxi. The same year a hurricane destroyed most of the new city, which was rebuilt in the grid pattern of today&rsquo;s French Quarter.</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;">In 1762 and 1763 France signed treaties ceding Louisiana to Spain. For 40 years New Orleans was a Spanish city, trading heavily with Cuba and Mexico and adopting the Spanish racial rules that allowed for a class of free people of color. The city was ravaged by fires in 1788 and 1794 and rebuilt in brick with buildings and a cathedral that still stand today. In 1803 Louisiana reverted to the French, Napol&eacute;on Bonaparte then sold it to the United States 20 days later in the Louisiana Purchase. The final battle of the War of 1812 was fought in defense of New Orleans; Colonel Andrew Jackson led a coalition of pirates, free blacks and Tennessee Volunteers to defeat a British force outside the city.</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;">During the first half of the 19<sup>th</sup> century, New Orleans became the United States&rsquo; wealthiest and third-largest city. Its port shipped the produce of much of the nation&rsquo;s interior to the Caribbean, South America and Europe. Thousands of slaves were sold in its markets, but its free black community thrived. Until 1830, the majority of its residents still spoke French.</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;">At the start of the Civil War, New Orleans was the largest city in the Confederacy but it was only a year until Union troops, having captured its downriver defenses, political force, as emancipated slaves and free people of color were brought into the political process and, with the 1870s rise of the White League and the Ku Klux Klan, forced black out of it. Although the rise of railroads made shipping on the Mississippi less essential than it had been, New Orleans remained a powerful and influential port.</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;">By 1900, the city&rsquo;s streetcars were electrified, and New Orleans jazz was born in its clubs and dance halls. They city grew. New pump technology drove the ambitious draining of the low-lying swampland located between the city&rsquo;s riverside crescent and Lake Pontchartrain. New levees and drainage canals meant that many residents could live below sea level. Hurricanes in 1909, 1915, 1947 and 1965 damaged the city, but never catastrophically.</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;">After World War II, suburbanization and conflicts over school integration drew many white residents out of the city, leaving a core that was increasingly African-American and impoverished. Despite these social changes, the city grew as a tourist attraction, with hundreds of thousands of annual visitors drawn to its Mardi Gras festivities and to the culture that had inspired playwright Tennessee Williams, trumpeter Louis Armstrong and chef Jean Galatoire.&nbsp;</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>3. Area &amp; Population</strong></p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;">New Orleans is located on the banks of the Mississippi River, approximately 105 miles (169 km) upriver from the Gulf of Mexico. According to the U.S Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 350 square miles (910&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>), of which 169 square miles (440&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>) is land and 181 square miles (470&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>) (52%) is water. Orleans Parish is the smallest parish by land area in Louisiana.</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The city is located in the Mississippi River Delta on the east and west banks of the Mississippi River and south of Lake Pontchartrain. The area along the river is characterized by ridges and hollows.</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;">A recent study notes that 51% of New Orleans is at or above sea level, with the more densely populated areas generally on higher ground. The average elevation of the city is currently between one and two feet (0.5&nbsp;m) below sea level, with some portions of the city as high as 20 feet (6&nbsp;m) at the base of the river levee in Uptown and others as low as 7 feet (2 m) below sea level in the farthest reaches of Eastern New Orleans.</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The Central Business District of New Orleans is located immediately north and west of the Mississippi River, and was historically called the &ldquo;American Quarter&rdquo; or &ldquo;American Sector&rdquo;. It was developed after the heart of French and Spanish settlement. It includes Lafayette Square. Most streets in this area fan out from a central point in the city. Major streets of the area include Canal Street, Poydras Street, Tulane Avenue and Loyola Avenue. Canal Street functions as the street which divides the traditional "downtown" area from the "uptown" area.</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;">New Orleans has a population of approximately 344,000 people with 60.2% of the population is African-American, 33% of Whites, 5.2% are of Hispanic/ Latino heritage, 2.9% of the population is from Asian ancestor, and 0.9% from American Indian and Alaska Native, while the 1.7% rest are people with two or more races.</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>4.&nbsp;</strong><strong>Facts &amp; Figures</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>New Orleans is known to be the place where Voodoo was introduced in to the U.S: One of the most prominent figures of New Orleans was Marie Laveau, an oracle who performed numerous exorcisms and voodoo rituals and who became widely known as the Voodoo Queen back in the 1800s.</li>\n<li>New Orleans and the surrounding areas were sold to Napoleon: At the beginning of the 19th century, both New Orleans and all the surrounding areas were sold to Napoleon Bonaparte during what was known as the Louisiana Purchase. This is one of the reasons why the city became one of the most important multicultural areas in the United States.</li>\n<li>The city has the highest number of historic districts: According to the National Register, New Orleans has no less than 20 historic districts, more than other cities in the US.</li>\n<li>New Orleans is home to the longest continuous bridge in the world, according to the Guinness Book of World Records &ndash; Lake Pontchartrain Causeway.</li>\n<li>The New Orleans Superdome is the largest enclosed arena in the world.</li>\n<li>The home of Poker: New Orleans is widely considered to be the birthplace of both poker and craps.</li>\n<li>New Orleans is famous for in terms of gastronomy, that is certainly the Creole Cuisine!

Weather</strong></p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The climate of New Orleans is humid subtropical, with short, generally mild winters and hot, humid summers. The monthly daily average temperature ranges from 53.4&nbsp;&deg;F (11.9&nbsp;&deg;C) in January to 83.3&nbsp;&deg;F (28.5&nbsp;&deg;C) in July and August. The average precipitation is 62.5 inches (1,590&nbsp;mm) annually; the summer months are the wettest, while October is the driest month.</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Hurricanes pose a severe threat to the area, and the city is particularly at risk because of its low elevation, because it is surrounded by water from the north, east, and south; and because of Louisiana's sinking coast. According to the Federal Emergency Management Agency, New Orleans is the nation's most vulnerable city to hurricanes.</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>6.

With gender-segregated spa and locker room areas, and guests requested to keep their voices down, an afternoon here will be a chill affair. Guests are completely nude, however, so the exceedingly modest should perhaps stay away. The proffered services, like having a masseuse stand on your back as part of a deep-tissue massage, are the biggest draw for many customers.</p>\n<p><strong>International Orange (2044 Fillmore St, 2nd Floor, San Francisco, CA 94115 &ndash; between California and Pine Sts)</strong>: This is the spot to go for some serious "you time."

Dispute Resolution</strong></p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>a. US. Arbitration Act</strong></p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The Federal Arbitration Act, federal arbitration law, governs these Terms and for reservations made by U.S. residents, the laws of the state in which your billing address is located, without regard to principles of conflicts of laws. Use of this Website is unauthorized in any jurisdiction that does not give effect to all provisions of this Agreement, including, without limitation, this paragraph.&nbsp;</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>b. Arbitration</strong></p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;">You agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof or the use of the Services (collectively "Disputes") will be settled by binding arbitration between you and Canarini with the sole exception that each party retains the right to bring an individual action in small claims court and the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party's copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents or other intellectual property rights.</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;">You acknowledge and agree that you and Canarini are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate as a plaintiff or class in any purported class action or representative proceeding. In addition, unless both you and Canarini agree in writing, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims and may not preside over any form of class or representative proceeding. If this specific paragraph is held unenforceable, then the entirety of this "Arbitration" section will be deemed void. Except as provided in the preceding sentence, the "Dispute Resolution" section will survive any termination of these Terms.</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>c. Arbitration Rules and Governing Law</strong></p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (the "AAA Rules") in effect at the time the Dispute is brought to arbitration, except as modified by this "Dispute Resolution" section. The AAA Rules are available at www.adr.org/arb_med or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879. The Federal Arbitration Act will govern the interpretation and enforcement of this Section.</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>d. Arbitration Process</strong></p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;">A party who desires to initiate arbitration must provide the other party with a written Demand for Arbitration as specified in the AAA Rules. (The AAA provides a form Demand for Arbitration at <a href="http://www.adr.org">www.adr.org</a> and a separate form for California residents at their website. The arbitrator will be either a retired judge or an attorney licensed to practice law in the state of California and will be selected by the parties from the AAA's roster of consumer dispute arbitrators. If the parties are unable to agree upon an arbitrator within seven (7) days of delivery of the Demand for Arbitration, then the AAA will appoint the arbitrator in accordance with the AAA Rules.</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>e. Arbitration Location and Procedure</strong></p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Unless you and Canarini agree otherwise, the arbitration will be conducted in the county where you reside. If your claim does not exceed $10,000, then the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents you and Canarini submit to the arbitrator, unless you request a hearing or the arbitrator determines that a hearing is necessary. If your claim exceeds $10,000, the AAA Rules will determine your right to a hearing. Subject to the AAA Rules, the arbitrator will have the discretion to direct a reasonable exchange of information by the parties, consistent with the expedited nature of the arbitration.</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>f. Arbitrator's Decision</strong></p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The arbitrator will render an award within the time frame specified in the AAA Rules. The arbitrator's decision will include the essential findings and conclusions upon which the arbitrator based the award. Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. The arbitrator's award damages must be consistent with the terms of the "Limitation of Liability" of these Terms as to the types and amount of damages that a party may be held liable. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the claimant and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the claimant's individual claim. If you prevail in arbitration you will not be entitled to an award of attorneys' fees and expenses, except if provided for under applicable law if any.</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>g. Arbitration Fees</strong></p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Your responsibility to pay any AAA filing, administrative and arbitrator fees will be set forth in the AAA Rules. However, if your claim for damages does not exceed $75,000, Canarini will pay all such fees, unless the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in your Demand for Arbitration was frivolous or was brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)). In that case, Canarini will be entitled to attorney&rsquo;s fees and cost if your Demand for Arbitration was frivolous or was brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)).</p>\n<p><strong>13.

593	I am a 36 year-old tourist guide who was born in Madrid. I love mi city and I am a specialist in the Madrid´s cultural heritage. I also have a good knowledge of historic cities around Madrid, like Alcalá de Henares, Aranjuez or El Escorial. If you are interested in passionately walking tours through the most tourist places of Madrid, I can show you them properly.  In addition, I´ll recommend you which main museums, top art exhibitions and tipical madrilenean restaurants you must visit in the city. And the most important thing: I will carry you to magic corners -not very known by tourists- so that your visit become an amazing experience.	\N	{"social": [], "at_bank": "Openbank", "live_in": "", "business": [], "first_aid": "", "experience": [], "first_tour": "", "home_phone": "", "credentials": [], "nationality": "", "office_phone": "", "account_number": "ES2300730100510543106587", "language_level": {"en": {"text": "Advanced", "level": "advanced"}, "es": {"text": "Mastery / Native", "level": "mastery"}}, "routing_number": "", "local_expertise": [], "benificiary_name": "Jesus Manuel Lopez Clavero", "is_children_friendly": "", "communicating_channels": [], "is_disability_friendly": ""}	\N	0	\N	{"hash":"jNtzTd0NkLfYeOGa7nHPMFXSySR+omQLxm9GZoXd8NrQHlStUDqTDE1sg15Vg/S7ox/qBy+A55BIEDxrDm3DP85V","salt":"AwE768GNIHFc193qVlMYg0d/+9O45C+iQgypKJ1D7R17LgOkvyJMIzv7aVQbZDAP5jg193cg97jKuY7BU+7KwQAs","keyLength":66,"hashMethod":"pbkdf2","iterations":541650}	Jesus	Lopez Clavero	jossclavero@gmail.com	+34910281847	male	1981-08-30 00:00:00+00	active	557b5290-2781-11e8-830c-29719caab50e	2018-03-14 10:52:05	tripyah	\N

636	¡Hola! Me llamo Lucía y soy de Sevilla. Estudié la carrera de turismo y posteriormente cursé la licenciatura de antropología social y cultural. Mi formación académica y experiencia profesional han girado en torno a éstos dos pilares. De hecho tengo más de 5 años de experiencia en éste sector. Actualmente compagino el trabajo de guía de turismo con el de informadora de turismo ya que también trabajo en la Oficina Municipal de Turismo de Alcalá de Guadaíra. Puede ver más información sobre mi perfil profesional en linkedin: www.linkedin.com/in/luciangalan/\n\nSería un placer ser su guía local enseñándole  Sevilla y sus pueblos como por ejemplo Alcalá de Guadaíra, Utrera o Carmona. A la vez de aprender sobre historia, arquitectura o arte aprenderá el estilo de vida de los locales, su cosmovisión, y lo podrá experimentar en sus propias carnes porque en mis visitas, además de lo más emblemático, enseño rincones y lugares en los que el visitante por su propia cuenta no lograría llegar. Por eso mis visitas tienen un toque antropológico, derivado de mi formación académica.  Personalmente pienso que uno de los objetivos de viajar es sumergirse en la cultura local, es muy enriquecedor y te hacer ver la vida desde otro punto de vista.  Estoy segura de que aprovechará al máximo su visita y lo más importante, la disfrutará :)  :)   :)   :)   :)   :)                      Hi! My name is Lucía and I'm from Sevilla. I studied tourism and later I studied social and cultural anthropology degree. My academic and professional experience has revolved around these two pillars. In fact I have more than 5 years of experience in this sector. Currently I combine the work of tourism guide with tourist information technician because I also work in the Municipal Tourism Office of Alcalá de Guadaíra. You can see more information about my professional profile on linkedin: www.linkedin.com/in/luciangalan/\n\nIt would be a pleasure to be your local guide and show you Sevilla and its towns such as Alcalá de Guadaíra, Utrera or Carmona. While learning about history, architecture or art you will learn the lifestyle of the locals, your worldview, and you can experience it in your own skin because in my visits I show corners and places where visitors would not arrive by themselves. That is why my visits have an anthropological touch, derived from my academic education. Personally, I think that one of the objectives of traveling is to immerse yourself in the local culture, it is very enriching. I am sure that you will make the most of your visit and most importantly, you will enjoy it :)	\N	{"social": [{"link": "tours.ayra", "name": "Instagram", "value": "instagram"}, {"link": "tours.ayra", "name": "Facebook", "value": "facebook"}], "at_bank": "", "live_in": "", "business": [], "first_aid": "", "experience": [], "first_tour": "", "home_phone": "", "credentials": [], "nationality": "", "office_phone": "", "account_number": "", "language_level": {"en": {"text": "Advanced", "level": "advanced"}, "es": {"text": "Mastery / Native", "level": "mastery"}}, "routing_number": "", "local_expertise": [], "benificiary_name": "", "is_children_friendly": false, "communicating_channels": [], "is_disability_friendly": false, "is_provide_transporation": true}	\N	0	\N	{"hash":"aewW2w3yX17qYjt3nBCwOmpEkFC7YLZKL3gVGsyUglJQPWgickSDUYuDgzvAh0aW2OD3kEOk+jwuxD9c3tm7ndmh","salt":"0ktqPDJEstwgn7qp3otEdrNJSMv3xpaHCbpKl4ZhAKH8VPIri/eKmV8KLYUG4BfzNF4LjXaJETQgL9ScYJkQ8JML","keyLength":66,"hashMethod":"pbkdf2","iterations":564790}	Lucía	Núñez Galán	luciangalan11@gmail.com	+34678036160	female	1986-03-11 00:00:00+00	active	f3c22f50-681d-11e8-8fc8-c3e54a4876aa	2018-04-27 15:06:56	tripyah	\N

645	¡Hola!\n\nI'm a 32 year old Belgian historian living in Madrid. I came here for love and on top of that I ended up adoring my new city. I am a very social person so I wanted to share my love for the city with other people.\nI like cultural activities as going to the movies, theatre and visiting museums, I practice a lot of sports (I love snowboarding, surfing, cycling and triathlon) and I have a passion for languages, books and music.\nAfter my Master Studies in History, I started working in development work. I managed projects in Philippines, South Africa and Burundi. My first contact with the tourism business was when I decided to combine my passion for snowboarding with my passion for people. So I became a guide for tour operators in the French Alpes for two winter seasons. Later, I also lived in Istanbul where I worked as a tour guide for a biking company. When I arrived in Madrid and I loved the city so much, I decided to continue my work as a city guide.\n\nI would love to show you around this wonderful city. I can guide you to the best museums, historical buildings, parks, scenic points or nice places and streets. I assure you a unique and authentic experience off the beaten path and into the hidden treasures and secrets of the city.\nI can be flexible with your agenda and fulfill any specific interests you have. Let me know your preferences and schedule and I will come up with an itinerary that suits your requirements and personal profile.\nWith me, you and Madrid will fall in love at first sight!\n\nHope to see you soon,\nCaroline	\N	{"social": [{"link": "https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100016115533412", "name": "Facebook", "value": "facebook"}], "at_bank": "Deutsche Bank", "live_in": "", "business": [], "first_aid": "", "experience": [], "first_tour": "", "home_phone": "", "credentials": [], "nationality": "", "office_phone": "", "account_number": "BE59 6105 6923 8026", "language_level": {}, "routing_number": "DEUTBEBE", "local_expertise": [], "benificiary_name": "Caroline Bekaert", "is_children_friendly": true, "communicating_channels": [], "is_disability_friendly": "", "is_provide_transporation": true}	\N	0	\N	{"hash":"gBdp712hI0XI5fgZU1EmFKe5fTAQJ5YBbrV+zukfiBeIX2OOqGvtXVX7RHLjtU1aQ5Ne7b6wZFhzoDW9EXdAuRpP","salt":"LRTr4/33fJCX4BYZlAnV+18xRtnT7aUM+zBh3lO2Q0X4g2zmxjbIZz7DWkPNNgnD45phEW2VtLUts/aKBEtkJgdr","keyLength":66,"hashMethod":"pbkdf2","iterations":573965}	Caroline	Bekaert	carbekaert@gmail.com	+32494928057	female	1985-07-05 00:00:00+00	active	7da40de0-637f-11e8-8fc8-c3e54a4876aa	2018-05-14 15:33:06	tripyah	\N

597	As a TripYah Guru, my job is to enthusiastically make culture accessible to my guests. \n\nI have a PhD on Philosophy and my main interest is the research and the study of the concrete expressions by which human beings from different eras and cultures embody and express the meaning of their existence. I have a special focus on the interpretation of material culture and its impact in the building of the different worldviews with which I have been in touch during my wanderings around the world. \n\nThis may sound terrifyingly theoretical or academic but, do not worry, my approach to it is very practical! \n\nMy aim is to enliven the culture for my guests, not through facts and data, but by propitiating a participation in it through and enjoyable exploration of different infrastructures (discursive, affective, and material). And, even when this is grounded on rigorous research, it is not aimed at experts but at a general public.\n\nI firmly believe in the profound relationship between truth and life, so I am constantly exploring that bond. My work in TripYah is one of those activities that allow me to live and share my passion, while getting to know people from all around the world.	\N	{"social": [{"link": "https://www.linkedin.com/in/leticiacortinaaracil/", "name": "LinkedIn", "value": "linkedin"}, {"link": "@Arkhairo", "name": "Twitter", "value": "twitter"}], "at_bank": "Bankia", "live_in": "", "business": [], "first_aid": "", "experience": [], "first_tour": "", "home_phone": "", "credentials": [], "nationality": "", "office_phone": "", "account_number": "ES3320382715663000295809", "language_level": {"en": {"text": "Mastery / Native", "level": "mastery"}, "es": {"text": "Mastery / Native", "level": "mastery"}}, "routing_number": "CAHMESMMXXX", "local_expertise": [], "benificiary_name": "Leticia Cortina Aracil", "is_children_friendly": true, "communicating_channels": [], "is_disability_friendly": true, "is_provide_transporation": false}	\N	0	\N	{"hash":"RndwV8mUjgmu5p7D+skF+IAJh89TJD2JdZ66qhlInHWrkwaty8vXTeUrps7wpsiBOAC4Zc6HUxWS/V7gdz8hwBHy","salt":"vWd9Z8fgYkjGKEqnR9U+Tb7nQkFx3JmVeY6Z3rng5KFL1/UkwOfbORHQr/s+LDVGKBZWnEdu/c1v+lNRuW57Kh6x","keyLength":66,"hashMethod":"pbkdf2","iterations":544763}	Leticia	Cortina	arkharis@gmail.com	+34609662576	female	1984-01-09 00:00:00+00	active	5284c0f0-2c39-11e8-830c-29719caab50e	2018-03-20 12:06:48	tripyah	\N

It will be a great pleasure for me to share my experience and show you my Madrid the way I see it and love it with its perfections and imperfection :) Be my guest!	\N	{"social": [{"link": "la_loca_en_madrid", "name": "Instagram", "value": "instagram"}, {"link": "https://www.facebook.com/arina.vasilenko", "name": "Facebook", "value": "facebook"}], "at_bank": "", "live_in": "", "business": [], "first_aid": "", "experience": [], "first_tour": "", "home_phone": "", "credentials": [], "nationality": "", "office_phone": "", "account_number": "", "language_level": {}, "routing_number": "", "local_expertise": [], "benificiary_name": "", "is_children_friendly": "", "communicating_channels": [], "is_disability_friendly": "", "is_provide_transporation": false}	\N	0	\N	{"hash":"oiZXia6in0vsjdsj8yRUye43l0/CXMBTrxOATkhAux6pJ0b2gbXDM0eDHTBE2I0PdhsuqBdiFu+gxicrjRA6fnfG","salt":"hvteVvJTdKZn0o/xkhwEp1Ts8MHixvLnczmypbA2cGQ4cChTSCdF0L9w47VNzJEhgZDl35KXTxlU8XUgdhha5pvy","keyLength":66,"hashMethod":"pbkdf2","iterations":574445}	Arina	Vasilenko	vasilenkoarina@mail.ru	+34603142330	female	1996-01-12 00:00:00+00	active	413dc030-583f-11e8-830c-29719caab50e	2018-05-15 12:45:04	tripyah	\N

613	It would be a pleasure to be your local host, to show you around making sure you get the most out of your visit. As a traveler myself, I don´t like "out of the can" solutions for touring around....and that is why I offer tours that are different; fun as well as interesting.\n\nI have been working as a guide for more than 15 years, and I have now set up my base between Madrid (Spain) and Santorini Island (Greece). I am privileged in that I can enjoy the best of a great cultural city, such as Madrid, and also relax & admire the beauty of a Greek island...\n\nI am therefore specialized in “feeling the places as a visitor, with the insight of a local”\n\nI invite you to discover and feel the meaning of Mediterranean culture.\n\nMy Background, Licenses and certificates\n\nI am an experienced guide with a very strong academic and professional background and have been in the tourism industry since the 90s.\n\nI had a bilingual education, both school and university, providing me with great communication skills as well as an instinct for adapting to different cultures and environments. My passion for travel was born when as a teenager I took part on several exchange programs to the UK and the USA. Since then I have continued to travel throughout the years.\n\nI was born and raised in Barcelona and then moved to Madrid. I attended a French primary and secondary school and then I moved again, this time to London. I studied BA International Business and French in London and I spent my Erasmus year in Paris. As I have itchy feet, that wasn´t enough and I moved to Greece where I started working as a guide and became a professional Tour Leader. I have attended workshops, seminars and courses related to business and cultural subjects, obtaining several certificates and diplomas, including recently the certificate from the “Comunidad de Madrid” for guides.	\N	{"social": [], "at_bank": "", "live_in": "", "business": [], "first_aid": "", "experience": [], "first_tour": "", "home_phone": "", "credentials": [], "nationality": "", "office_phone": "", "account_number": "", "language_level": {"en": {"text": "Mastery / Native", "level": "mastery"}, "es": {"text": "Mastery / Native", "level": "mastery"}, "fr": {"text": "Advanced", "level": "advanced"}, "it": {"text": "Advanced", "level": "advanced"}}, "routing_number": "", "local_expertise": [], "benificiary_name": "", "is_children_friendly": true, "communicating_channels": [], "is_disability_friendly": true, "is_provide_transporation": true}	\N	0	\N	{"hash":"X5Tid+tGHciBZawQ2pgasE3dDC/BUcOXx0aCg4jN9aUZUHYoYJZ4qku7krGb4OgdfCtJ2A0c6wxihb6EaXpA4rFJ","salt":"3tG7e1Q9kLHfFvlf8YVaDlXs2tDDgtVgWxkSuOOGLwmPZ3LW8k+zoX6CcCFahZf5+CNWsizcT52zDitBpBRrNICG","keyLength":66,"hashMethod":"pbkdf2","iterations":552446}	Maria	Bosch	mamenbs@gmail.com	+34693803251	female	1974-01-29 00:00:00+00	active	46e63b30-37d7-11e8-830c-29719caab50e	2018-04-04 07:02:13	tripyah	\N
