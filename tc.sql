Good tour guides can make or break a trip as they will show people places and things that the visitor would not have discovered otherwise.</span></p><p><b><span>On Site Guides:</span></b><span> Locally in specific locations, such as in museums, castles, art galleries, historic houses or gardens. They guide visitors through the attraction, and as they are based in a specific location become extremely knowledgeable about the facility. These are usually guides who work for a tour company, escorting tourists on day trips either around the area or out of the area to see attractions that can be accessed within the confines of one day.</span></p><p><b><span>City Guides:</span></b><span> In cities, leading visitors on walking tours of famous landmarks or sites, or working as a guide on coaches or boats that ply their tourism trade around the city.</span></p><p><b><span>Special Interest Guides: </span></b><span>Work in an area escorting tours around specific sites such as battlegrounds or sporting stadiums. Their detailed knowledge of the site and its history brings alive the venue to visitors. Such guides may also work during events, such at during the Olympics, Chelsea Garden Show or Munich Beer Festival. They can help visitors get the best out of their visit to the event and save on time wasted<br/>looking for transport and local information. </span></p><p><b>Personal/Private </b><b>Guides: </b><span>Personal guides can be hired by the day, half day or other periods, escorting </span><span>visitors to sites or attractions they specifically have knowledge on. </span><span>Local knowledge is a real bonus with such guides who can often access places </span><span>not on the public tour trail, meeting people who can share the culture and traditions </span><span>of the area.</span></p><p><b><span>Step-on Guides:</span></b><span> This kind of guide is a free-lance guide, specialists who come on-board a coach or bus to give informed commentaries of the city being toured. This is usually for pre-booked tour groups who may already be travelling with their own tour guide who has escorted them around the country but whose knowledge of specific cities will be less detailed than that of a local city guide. Step-on guides are usually<br/>licensed and literally ‘step on’ the tour bus as it enters the city, guides the<br/>bus and its passengers through the city delivering interesting commentary, and<br/>then steps-off the bus as it exits the city at the end of the tour.</span></p><p><b><span>Country Tour Guides/Tour Escort:</span></b><span> Travelling with clients, guiding them to, around, and from various locations. Tours of Europe, for example, often include a tour guide who joins at the start of the tour in London and who travels with the tour bus around<br/>Europe for a week or two, providing help and assistance to the passengers,<br/>managing passenger lists, luggage, hotel bookings and organising city tours<br/>along the way. In some cases the tour guide will also help arrange meals,<br/>special events such as passes into festivals or cultural events, and in the<br/>case of Contiki Tours will also organise the cooking of lunches with the<br/>passengers along the way. Tour guides of this type work for the tour operator.<br/>The tour operator organises the tour, sells the tour and sets up arrangements<br/>ready for the tour guide. As such tours are often lengthy (several weeks) it is<br/>invaluable to have a tour guide on board who can resolve problems as they<br/>arise, looks after the passengers and generally keeps the tour ticking along on<br/>schedule.  Tour guides on these kind of trips will stay with their tour<br/>group for days or even weeks, and this type of guiding is also known as ‘tour<br/>conducting.’</span></p><p><b><span>Specialized/Outdoor Guides: </span></b><span>This category of guide has particular skills that match the client’s needs. These guides conduct bike tours, white water rafting trips, jet boating, skiing, hiking expeditions or on tours that are more physically demanding and unusual. They may even be guides in certain types of transport such as leading<br/>motor cycle or cycling tours.

Health </b><br/>As a tour guide, you will travel to places via different types of transportation, where the working condition is varying from indoor to outdoor, with the constant changing of climate and weather. Therefore, a tour guide must take good care of his health as the first priority, doing so through these simple steps: <br/>- Eat well<br/>- Keep your body hydrated (always carry a bottle of water in your bag)<br/>- Appropriate footwear (comfortable and suitable for the working environment)<br/>- Protect yourself under the heat (carry sun block, hats, or umbrella, as well as water to avoid heat stroke and dehydration)<br/>- Prepare for a sudden change of weather or any other emergencies (Carry a rain coats and sweater in case of rain; always have First-Aid kit nearby in case of emergency)<br/><br/><b>2. Safety </b><br/>Whether working on a tour bus or walking tour, a tour guide needs to be well prepared for safety precautions, include:<br/>• Brief your passengers on any potential dangers during the tour or in the area.<br/>• Keep your passengers safe from traffic obstacles.<br/>• Give them warnings on any potential pick-pockets or scams in the area.<br/>• Direct visitors away from traffic as they might be distracted from sightseeing and other surrounding sceneries. <br/>• Ensure all passengers are seated during the trip; minimize moving and standing up while the vehicle is in motion to avoid falling and injuries in case of sudden stops.<br/>• For passengers with disabilities (PWD), hydraulic lifts for the vehicle will be required. Make sure the designated area is always available for them.</p><p><b>3. Logistics Management </b><br/>Common logistics that need to be practiced: <br/>• Check all movements and details the day before departure, as well as the vehicle and driver (if the vehicle is registered, suitable, clean, equipped with emergency evacuation, qualified for the trip; if the driver is qualified and had reliable road records with background check, if applicable)<br/>• Check that the driver is on route to pick up and is on time for the schedule departure.<br/>• Check and confirm the driver that the vehicle is in position and has made contact with the group.<br/>• Memorize the vehicle plate number; also advice the group to take down notes on the vehicle and driver’s information before departing. <br/>• Remember to conduct a head count of the group at the beginning of the tour and during the tour.<br/>• Counsel passengers to take their possession with them when leaving the bus or after a stop on the tour.<br/>• Assist the driver with any emergency, traffic problems or passengers’ requests for amendments.</p><p><b>4. Emergency Handling </b><br/>Emergencies or tricky situations may arise during any tour. They might include:<br/>- Passengers’ fallen ill and required more than basic first-aid<br/>- Luggage lost during the tour<br/>- The tour bus is involved in a traffic accident or break down<br/>- One or more members of the group involve in a breach of local laws.<br/>- Passengers lose their passports/visa/money or other important documentations during the trip.<br/>- Overbooking of accommodation at the tour destination<br/>- Flood, typhoon or any other sudden natural disaster causing the cancellation of tour activities.<br/></p><p><b>Handling EMERGENCY:</b><br/></p><p><b>STAY CALM</b> is the first golden rule to deal with any emergency issue. There is no good in panicking!<br/>In order to overcome any arising emergency, a tour guide must:<br/>- Identify the issue and additional information or resources needed to resolve it.<br/>- Rationally enlist step-by-step on how to overcome the issue. Allow helps, supports and assistance from other passengers if they have experience and knowledge on how to deal with that particular issue.<br/>- For passengers who can’t be in assistance, ensure they are moved into a safe place while you and others capable passengers handling the situation. <br/>- With any medical emergency, you must first ask if there is a doctor on board who could help, and that person will look after the sick person while you call for the ambulance or other medical services.<br/>- Be clear and concise in your communication to passengers and others. (what happened, how it happened and the result of it) <br/>- Work with medical staff or the authorities to help directing people on where you they should be, as well as instructing them in what they can do to help.<br/>- Keep your colleagues involved and if given instructions by them, follow and keep them informed through the process. <br/></p>	<p>-    Eat well, Keep your body hydrated <br/>-    Appropriate footwear and clothes<br/>-    Brief your passengers on any potential dangers during the tour or in the area.<br/>-    Keep your passengers safe from traffic obstacles.<br/>-    Ensure all passengers are seated during the trip; <br/>-    For passengers with disabilities (PWD), hydraulic lifts for the vehicle will be required.<br/>-    Common logistics need to be always practised<br/>-    Stay Calm in handling emergency<br/>-    With any medical emergency, you must first ask if there is a doctor on board who could help<br/></p>	https://youtu.be/x6wgkSo_Ywk	5	1

This is a key motivator for many people who enter tour guiding as a careers.</p><p>This is not a 9-5 job and many people enjoy the different hours and work schedule, based outside of an office with the chance to enjoy a different group of people to work with each day or week.</p><p>Many tour guides enjoy the ‘performance’ of tour guiding! The delivery of the commentary, telling of jokes and tales, making people laugh or holding their attention, these are all features of the tour guiding role that tour guides enjoy.<br/>The opportunity to meet groups of new people regularly is a key motivator for tour guides. There is little chance to become bored as each group brings interest and challenge.</p><p>Many tour guides establish firm friendships with their visitors, and the sense of a ‘job well done’ adds significantly to a sense of job satisfaction.<br/>Country tour guides or tour escorts have the opportunity to travel to new and exciting places at no cost to themselves, and the excitement of leading tours to far flung destinations is both thrilling and nerve wracking! Many people thrive on the challenges that escorting long tours can bring as each tour group and itinerary is different.</p><p>Even city guides can benefit from the ability to visit attractions, sites or special events at no cost, and often at close quarters. Your employer will pay any entrance fees for guides and the attraction may provide additional benefits such as complimentary catering for tour guides.</p><p>Tour guides are paid a salary but often earn significant additional money in tips from the visitors as recognition for a job well done. Over a visiting season these tips can often be more than the basic salary and may make up for the lack of work in any off-season periods.</p><p>Tour guiding is sometimes a flexible role that is suited to students, people on their overseas experience, or a vocation for those who prefer to do seasonal work. The work may be part time, and some people work as a free-lance tour guide working as much or as little as they choose, depending on their specific situation. It can be a great way to supplement an income whilst providing a stimulating working environment.</p><h3><b>The drawbacks of tour guiding</b></h3><p>Whilst there are many advantages and perks associated with tour guide work, there are also some downsides.</p><p>• The hours can be long and erratic, and because of it’s seasonal nature the year is often divided into a super busy phase (usually the summer) then a very quiet winter.</p><p>• Earnings can be variable and tour guides have to plan their finances so the money earned in high season will see them through the quiet periods.</p><p>• There is pressure to keep up your destinational knowledge so your commentaries are up to date and interesting, and much of that is done outside of work in your own time.</p><p>• Not all clients are easy to get along with, and some can be quite tricky, particularly if they are knowledgable about the area and/or they sense you are not up to speed with your knowledge.<br/></p>	<p style="text-align: justify;font-size: 14px;">Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.

22	en	<p><b>1.  Consider your Personal Qualities and Job Requirements</b><br/></p><p>A professional tour guide must possess and establish these below factors: <br/><b>- People-oriented:</b> This job is all about interaction with people. It is a critical personal character that one must already had. You must enjoy dealing with people of all occupations, such as customers, suppliers, your colleagues…  <br/><b>-  Energetic and in good health:</b> Tour guiding requires a certain level of physical fitness as the job involves ongoing walking and talking, constant moving on and off vehicles, unusual working-hour outdoor and indoor. Fitness is especially crucial during the peak of tourism season, when taking sick leaves without prior notice might result in stranded coach full of tourists without a tour guide.<br/><b>- A love for destinations you are guiding:</b> Feeling passionate about any locations that you are tour guiding will give you more motivation in portraying the sites with interests and facts which involve a touch of your personal experience (positive only). Those are essential to make the tour commentary memorable to your group of visitors. If you have to pretend to like a place, you shouldn’t be tour guiding there.<br/><b>- Knowledgeable:</b>  To establish your credibility as a tour guide, you need to know thoroughly everything about the destination: from the natural facts, historical stories, cultural life style, the city’s  attraction, local restaurants , the do’s and the don’t … This requires you to do an additional research besides the basic knowledge in the training courses. You need to work hard in expanding your own knowledge so your commentary is more informative and interesting. Knowledge is needed to provide better services to your customers in order to achieve more success in your career.<br/><b>- Trustworthiness: </b>As a tour guide, you will be handling important documents, luggages, and money to pay for entrance fees or other tour related costs. Therefore, it is critical that you establish an honest working ethics so that customers and company feel comfortable being on the tour you guide. As such, police checks are most likely the first requirement prior to your application to any potential employer. <br/><b>- Patience:</b>   There are a lot of issues on tours that will test your patience, such as traffics, flight delays, passengers who get lost or lost track of time, dealing with the local offices or government, and so on. Having a calm and collective mind-set is necessary to keep yourself flexible at all kinds of situations in order to come up to the best solutions, and also to help your customers better. Be cool and mindful with your passengers, suppliers and the general public. <br/><b>-  Organised:</b> Timing is everything and therefore, to be well prepared at all times is essential to being a professional tour guide. Knowing where to be, when to be and what to bring will require you to carefully plan on your own check lists for all the necessary documents, booking confirmation, guest lists, train or flight information. Each customers might be different so ensure everything is clear so you don’t waste times and looking unprofessional.  <br/><b>- Punctual:</b>  As a Tour guide, you will need to follow the schedule of the tour itineraries  and programs. Not only must you be on time but you have to be early than anyone else.  Be the first person to arrive at any departure point to wait for your customers is the way to create a good impression from the beginning with your group. <br/><b>- Adaptable and Flexible: </b> Tours are subject to change in the last minute from time to time due to transportation or other aspect of the tour. Therefore, a professional tour guide needs to be trained in being adaptable with all types of changes that might occur during the tour. Moreover, being flexible to come up with new solutions to operate within the trip will not only help to maintain a good trip but also build up a better connection and relationship with your customers, suppliers and others. <br/><b>-  Resourceful and Creative:</b> As a tour guide, you need to expect the unexpected, despite being provided with all itinerary, passengers and transportation. Your passengers might get sick during the trip, there are more people added or less people to the group, changing route, or one of the attractions you are scheduled to visit is closed… In such situations, it’s no time to be confused or stressed out but to immediately come up with other ways to fulfil the trip. The ability to be creative is one thing that differentiates tour guides. Those who are more creative and resourceful will indeed appear more reliable to customers and suppliers. <br/><b>- Ethical:</b>  It is important that you maintain an ethical standard for your profession as a tour guide. You might get offered incentives under monetary or gifts forms to take tourists to certain places, sites, or shops that are not in the original established itinerary in order for them to buy something from that particular destination. This is unprofessional and is considered forbidden. Thus, it is necessary to keep in mind and not fallen into this trap. <br/><b>- Language skill:</b> As a tour guide, you will be working with customers from all around the world, therefore, being able to speak more than one language will give you a great advantage when communicating with customers. Moreover, tour guides need to possess excellent interpersonal skill and the ability to work unremittingly for their customers from the beginning of the trip until the end when customers are returned safely. <br/></p><p><b>2.

A presentation enables the tour guide to show his group that he is enthusiast and devoted to deliver the best for his customers. <br/></p><p><b>Tour Commentary Planning</b><br/>For the best quality of any public presentation or commentary, a thorough planning is compulsory and you can achieve it by following these basic steps:<br/>•    Understand the needs and interests of your tour group in order to create an interesting schedule.<br/>•    Have all the itinerary details such as duration, features of the tour confirmed<br/>•    Carefully research and gather all the detailed information about the sights to be visited<br/>•    Prepare the text based on these facts and any additional anecdotes that might be relevant<br/>•    Read through the texts and practice the delivery until you are confident delivery your speech without the need to depends on your written notes.</p><p><b>Delivering Tour Commentary:</b><br/>-  Presentation and commentaries include:<br/>1.    Welcoming Tourists<br/>2.    Describing the visiting destinations<br/>3.    Create positive back and forth interactions with your group.<br/>4.    Closing Remarks</p><p><b>1. Welcoming Tourist </b><br/>- Introduce yourself  to the group along with a short bio, such as “Good morning – my name is …  and I’ll be your tour guide this morning. I’ve lived in [insert city] for the past [insert time] and am looking forward to spending time with you today and show you all the exciting and wonderful things about this city.”</p><p>Regular announcement   <br/>•    Ensure that all your guests are comfortably seated before departure.<br/>•    Briefly show and demonstrate the safety steps for emergency evacuation.<br/>•    Provide general information of the trip duration, routes, weather, and the hotel where guests will be staying.<br/>•    Introduce the driver to all guests.<br/>•    Brief on refreshment stops<br/>•    Reminding guests on No-smoking rule and stay safe on the trip<br/>•    Welcome to your destination!<br/>•    At the start of the tour, make sure your guests understand which way it is when you say “left and right”.</p><p><b>2. Describing the destination: </b><br/>- This is the time to use your presentation skill. Present all the facts and information on the history, culture and unique remarks of the visited destination. <br/>- Information will be vary from different places. Therefore, focus on telling your group more about the remarks in each location (some might be the natural history on nature, others might be the interesting customs and traditions of generations of people)<br/>- Giving your group a bit of fun facts is always a great way to engage their attentions and make the trip more memorable. <br/></p><p><b>3.  Interact with your guests</b><br/>-  Speak with moderation to allow some quiet time for your guests to think and process information they’ve received from you.<br/>-  Prepare some fun stories and quizzes with wining prizes for everyone in order to encourage interactions among your guests, create a friendship between each other to make the trip more exciting.  <br/>- Schedule photo opportunities from times to times to let the group capture their trip.</p><p><b>4. Closing Remarks</b><br/>-  Inform your group that the tour is going to an end. <br/>- Ask your guests if they have any questions<br/>-  Announce the next schedule if applicable<br/>- Remind your passengers to check their belongings before leaving the seats.</p><p>For example:  Ladies and Gentlemen, we are going to return to the hotel in just a few minutes. Please sit back and enjoy the view as we slowly enter the city.  Please remain in your seats until we have arrived at the destination. Our driver will be meeting us at the front entrance to help you with your bags and luggage. Please double check to make sure your bags had been taken off the bus. On behalf of Canary Tour Guides, we hope you have had a wonderful time in Washington D.C and enjoy the rest of your trip. <br/></p><p><b>Audio System for Tour Commentary</b><br/>Tour guides working on coaches, boats and cruises will be very familiar with the use of the on-board PA ( Passenger Announcement )  System and its microphone.<br/>-  A PA system is basically an audio system of microphone and amplifiers/speakers used to transmit a message to groups of people across a large area.<br/>- Any messages conveyed using a PA system should be brief, informative and relevant. Some issues occurring with PA system might include:<br/>•    Poor quality of the sound sometimes failed to deliver announcements to passengers.<br/>•    Language difficulties, again is sometimes distorted through the PA system.<br/>- Great focus on the content and clarity of the message will reduce passenger confusion and help to generate the information effectively. <br/>- Some automated systems can translate and announce in different languages. This reduces the need for guiding staff to switch languages when making routine commentary. These automated systems are usually based on GPS, prompting the system to generate particular messages are particular points/sights.</p><p>The technical tips for using a ‘mic’ are relatively standard:<br/>-    Hold the microphone about 30 centimetres away from your face and speak in a normal tone.  <br/>-    Ask your passengers if they can all hear you clearly? If not, try holding the mic closer before raising your voice, but not too close as you may experience a whining noise called ‘feedback’.<br/>-    If possible, turn around to face the group, but safety restrictions on board might mean that you have to sit facing forward. <br/>-    Do your best at projecting your voice, monitor the pitch and speed of your sentences from time to time to make sure your passengers hear you and do not get bored. <br/>-    Some tour buses may feature a wireless microphone or headset, which allows greater movement for the tour guide. These are well worth trying but you may need some practices to perfect the delivery using the headset.<br/></p>	<p>Presentation and commentaries include:<br/>1.    Hold the microphone about 30 centimetres away from your face and speak in a normal tone.  <br/>2.    Welcoming Tourists : Introduce yourself , announce the regular information &amp; requirement of the trip<br/>3.    Describing the visiting destinations<br/>4.    Do your best at projecting your voice, monitor the pitch and speed of your sentences from time to time to make sure your passengers hear you and do not get bored. <br/>5.    Create positive back and forth interactions with your group.<br/>6.    Closing Remarks <br/><br/></p>	https://youtu.be/CCUYtm5lvuo	5	1
24	en	<p>Here are some tips and considerations for guiding duties.</p><p><b>Front seat or Back seat?</b><br/>- Find the best place to stand that allow you to see all the passengers and vice versa but careful not to obstruct the driver’s view of the road or side mirrors. <br/>- Sitting at the front of the bus allows the tour guide to communicate with the driver on relevant matters.  It also enhances the engagement between you and your guests and face-to-face guiding creates a more trusting connection rather than talking from the back. <br/>- The tour guide should stand up from time to time and speak to the group while facing them.<br/>Pace &amp; Delivery on passing through attractions<br/>-  At the start of the tour, let your group know which way it is when you say ‘left and right’. <br/>-   Be specific with your directions – avoid pointing whilst saying “over there”, but rather ‘to the front and on your left” for example.<br/>-  Practice timing the delivery speech – “coming up on the right…” so as the vehicle approaches the sight, passengers will be looking at the right direction. There is nothing that annoys visitors more than being told ‘we just passed the most famous building in the world’ when they didn’t have a chance to see it because you didn’t time the speech right.<br/>- If you can choose the route, choose a circular itinerary so you can circle important streets twice. This will allow visitors on both sides of the vehicle to have a better sight-seeing opportunity.<br/>- Pace the commentary according to the speed of the vehicle and the traffic flow.<br/>- Sometimes there may be nothing interested to see on the road, so tell some funny stories or create quizzes for your group.  Alternatively, you can stretch your commentary during the dull phases with stories and anecdotes until there are an interesting sight coming up.<br/>- A guide person must be an excellent story teller, who is able to conjure up images with words and descriptions. It’s also encouraging to add personal comments if you live in the area, engage passengers through words, pictures, and narrations. <br/>- When adding personal comments, if you live in the area being toured, be selective with the stories. (avoid stories related to sensitive issues such as politics, religions, races or genders)<br/>- Do NOT speak non-stop! Aim to speak around 80% of the time and leave some thinking/quiet time for the passengers to chat amongst themselves, and to digest what you have said. <br/>-  Avoid using pre-prepared notes as prompters.<br/>-  Don’t overly rely the speech on your written notes because it shows an unprofessional attitude and passengers will lose confidence in your knowledge.</p><p><b>Delivering Commentaries on Walking Tours</b><br/>If you are tour guiding a walking tour, there are some additional factors to remember:<br/>1.  Make sure that the walking pace is appropriate to the group, and to the tour itself.  This isn’t a race! The tour guide must always be in the front to lead the tour, and ensure that the group are close behind. Keep an eye out for slow walkers to adjust the pace to suit everyone.<br/>2. It isn’t necessary to talk while walking because you’ll be facing away from the group and they won’t be able to hear you! <br/>3. Limit your formal commentary to moments when you stop walking. Ideally, find a slightly higher area where you can gather the group closely around you in a semi-circle and deliver the commentary. <br/>4. A step or a rock will be okay to stay on. Some guides carry portable steps for this specific purpose. <br/>5. When delivering commentaries outside, you will have to focus on your voice projection so everyone can hear you.<br/>6.  When a question is asked, you should repeat the question so the whole group can hear it then answer loud and clear. This will also prevent the same question being asked multiple times!<br/>7. Carry your guide notes with you, but don’t read from them during the tour. They are only for assisting purpose to ensure your speech is delivered thoroughly and in order (you can revise your notes whilst walking/ or in private).<br/>8. The facts and history of the tour are the key parts of the commentary that all tour guides must memorize. How you deliver them is up to you. You may change it from tour to tour. <br/>9.  A walking tour should have a conversational quality about it, with the tour guide painting word pictures to describe the attraction and its history.<br/></p>	<p>- The tour guide should stand up from time to time and speak to the group while facing them.<br/>- Be specific with your directions-  At the start of the tour, let your group know which way it is when you say ‘left and right’. <br/>- Pace the commentary according to the speed of the vehicle and the traffic flow.<br/>- Sometimes there may be nothing interested to see on the road, so tell some funny stories or create quizzes for your group<br/>- Avoid stories related to sensitive issues such as politics, religions, races or genders<br/>- Do NOT speak non-stop!<br/>- Avoid using pre-prepared notes as prompters.<br/>- When a question is asked, you should repeat the question so the whole group can hear it then answer loud and clear<br/>- For walking tour, find a slightly higher area where you can gather the group closely around you in a semi-circle and deliver the commentary. <br/></p>	https://youtu.be/KZDGPAJWgK0	5	1
26	en	<p><b>TIPS for a good Presentation</b></p><p><b>During the presentation, you SHOULD: </b><br/>-  Make your commentary interesting, relevant, simple, and deliver it in a logical sequence.<br/>- Be sensitive to the interests of the group to tailor the tour that would suit them best.<br/>- Seek feedback throughout the tour to improve and develop more contents to deliver if needed for your guests.<br/>- Focus on what you and your visitors can see, and on what you know. Be specific, share the facts and paint a word picture about the site or attraction.<br/>- Be flexible and accommodating towards members of your tour group: make sure everybody can hear you, take times to engage with the people at the back, make eyes contact with them and allow the group to question, comment, and actively take part equally during the tour.<br/>- Allow enough time at each stop so the visitors can fully enjoy the tour, digest the information you are sharing, and take photographs etc.<br/>- Anticipate questions from your group, and be ready to share the answers with the whole group as a question from one person might reflect what others in the group are thinking/ or wondering. <br/>- Whilst you may take this tour often and know the commentary well, remember this might be your guests’ first visiting, so keep your content and delivery style up-to-date to ensure you don’t recycle the same old speech over and over.<br/>- Adding new or revised information on the tour, including recent anecdotes or stories, and work towards continuous improvement in your delivery.<br/>- One of the ways, in which good tour guides keep their commentary fresh, is to look at the sight or attraction through the eyes of a new visitor. What would a new visitor like to know about it? Which are the most interesting aspect of it, and how could you tell its story to maintain their engagement throughout the tour?<br/><br/><b>Tactics to keeping the group enthusiastic</b></p><p>- Keep the commentary light. People travel for enjoyment so present the facts with a sense of humour. Be witty but also monitor your tone of voice to allow variation and emphasis.<br/>- Keep the narrations positive. Each country or province has problems, but do NOT dwell on them and focus on the positive things instead.<br/>- Personalize the information. Groups are curious about the guide’s personal and professional life. Turn this curiosity to an advantage and weave some personal information in the commentary. Do so moderately.<br/>- Know your audience and involve them. Tailor the information to each particular group. If the group is farmers or accountants, point out sites that they might find most interesting. Schedule and allow many photo opportunities as the tour will allow.<br/>- Be accurate and specific. Present information in an academic manner that is accurate and specific. Quiz the visitors on the commentary to add some entertainment.<br/></p>	<p>-    Make your commentary interesting<br/>-    Focus on what you and your visitors can see,<br/>-    Be specific<br/>-    Be sensitive to the interests of the group<br/>-    Allow enough time at each stop so the visitors can fully enjoy the tour<br/>-    Anticipate questions<br/></p>	https://youtu.be/8c9SOIP44AE	1	1

32	en	<p>1. Consider your Personal Qualities and Job Requirements<br/><br/>A professional tour guide must possess and establish these below factors:<br/>- People-oriented: This job is all about interaction with people. It is a critical personal character that one must already had. You must enjoy dealing with people of all occupations, such as customers, suppliers, your colleagues…<br/>- Energetic and in good health: Tour guiding requires a certain level of physical fitness as the job involves ongoing walking and talking, constant moving on and off vehicles, unusual working-hour outdoor and indoor. Fitness is especially crucial during the peak of tourism season, when taking sick leaves without prior notice might result in stranded coach full of tourists without a tour guide.<br/>- A love for destinations you are guiding: Feeling passionate about any locations that you are tour guiding will give you more motivation in portraying the sites with interests and facts which involve a touch of your personal experience (positive only). Those are essential to make the tour commentary memorable to your group of visitors. If you have to pretend to like a place, you shouldn’t be tour guiding there.<br/>- Knowledgeable: To establish your credibility as a tour guide, you need to know thoroughly everything about the destination: from the natural facts, historical stories, cultural life style, the city’s attraction, local restaurants , the do’s and the don’t … This requires you to do an additional research besides the basic knowledge in the training courses. You need to work hard in expanding your own knowledge so your commentary is more informative and interesting. Knowledge is needed to provide better services to your customers in order to achieve more success in your career.<br/>- Trustworthiness: As a tour guide, you will be handling important documents, luggages, and money to pay for entrance fees or other tour related costs. Therefore, it is critical that you establish an honest working ethics so that customers and company feel comfortable being on the tour you guide. As such, police checks are most likely the first requirement prior to your application to any potential employer.<br/>- Patience: There are a lot of issues on tours that will test your patience, such as traffics, flight delays, passengers who get lost or lost track of time, dealing with the local offices or government, and so on. Having a calm and collective mind-set is necessary to keep yourself flexible at all kinds of situations in order to come up to the best solutions, and also to help your customers better. Be cool and mindful with your passengers, suppliers and the general public.<br/>- Organised: Timing is everything and therefore, to be well prepared at all times is essential to being a professional tour guide. Knowing where to be, when to be and what to bring will require you to carefully plan on your own check lists for all the necessary documents, booking confirmation, guest lists, train or flight information. Each customers might be different so ensure everything is clear so you don’t waste times and looking unprofessional.<br/>- Punctual: As a Tour guide, you will need to follow the schedule of the tour itineraries and programs. Not only must you be on time but you have to be early than anyone else. Be the first person to arrive at any departure point to wait for your customers is the way to create a good impression from the beginning with your group.<br/>- Adaptable and Flexible: Tours are subject to change in the last minute from time to time due to transportation or other aspect of the tour. Therefore, a professional tour guide needs to be trained in being adaptable with all types of changes that might occur during the tour. Moreover, being flexible to come up with new solutions to operate within the trip will not only help to maintain a good trip but also build up a better connection and relationship with your customers, suppliers and others.<br/>- Resourceful and Creative: As a tour guide, you need to expect the unexpected, despite being provided with all itinerary, passengers and transportation. Your passengers might get sick during the trip, there are more people added or less people to the group, changing route, or one of the attractions you are scheduled to visit is closed… In such situations, it’s no time to be confused or stressed out but to immediately come up with other ways to fulfil the trip. The ability to be creative is one thing that differentiates tour guides. Those who are more creative and resourceful will indeed appear more reliable to customers and suppliers.<br/>- Ethical: It is important that you maintain an ethical standard for your profession as a tour guide. You might get offered incentives under monetary or gifts forms to take tourists to certain places, sites, or shops that are not in the original established itinerary in order for them to buy something from that particular destination. This is unprofessional and is considered forbidden. Thus, it is necessary to keep in mind and not fallen into this trap.<br/>- Language skill: As a tour guide, you will be working with customers from all around the world, therefore, being able to speak more than one language will give you a great advantage when communicating with customers. Moreover, tour guides need to possess excellent interpersonal skill and the ability to work unremittingly for their customers from the beginning of the trip until the end when customers are returned safely.<br/><br/>2.

34	en	<p>Public speaking comes under a lot of different forms, the two most important forms required for a tour guide profession are Presentation and Commentary. Public engaging, connecting with the customers is a fundamental aspect to being a successful tour guide.<br/><br/><b>- Commentary</b> is a technique when a tour guide engages his/her visitors on a tour bus, boat, or other on-board transportation with commentaries about the upcoming locations or any fun facts and comments to keep visitors informed and entertained.<br/><b>- Presentations</b> are usually conducted face-to-face at an attraction or a touristic site. Vocal delivery is the most important part of a presentation where hand motions, body languages and tone of voice must be used wisely to increase engagement. A presentation enables the tour guide to show his group that he is enthusiast and devoted to deliver the best for his customers.<br/><br/><b>Tour Commentary Planning</b><br/>For the best quality of any public presentation or commentary, a thorough planning is compulsory and you can achieve it by following these basic steps:<br/>•    Understand the needs and interests of your tour group in order to create an interesting schedule.<br/>•    Have all the itinerary details such as duration, features of the tour confirmed<br/>•    Carefully research and gather all the detailed information about the sights to be visited<br/>•    Prepare the text based on these facts and any additional anecdotes that might be relevant<br/>•    Read through the texts and practice the delivery until you are confident delivery your speech without the need to depends on your written notes.<br/><br/><b>Delivering Tour Commentary:</b><br/>- Presentation and commentaries include:<br/>1.    Welcoming Tourists<br/>2.    Describing the visiting destinations<br/>3.    Create positive back and forth interactions with your group.<br/>4.    Closing Remarks<br/><br/><b>1. Welcoming Tourist</b><br/>- Introduce yourself to the group along with a short bio, such as “Good morning – my name is … and I’ll be your tour guide this morning. I’ve lived in [insert city] for the past [insert time] and am looking forward to spending time with you today and show you all the exciting and wonderful things about this city.”<br/><br/>Regular announcement<br/>•    Ensure that all your guests are comfortably seated before departure.<br/>•    Briefly show and demonstrate the safety steps for emergency evacuation.<br/>•    Provide general information of the trip duration, routes, weather, and the hotel where guests will be staying.<br/>•    Introduce the driver to all guests.<br/>•    Brief on refreshment stops<br/>•    Reminding guests on No-smoking rule and stay safe on the trip<br/>•    Welcome to your destination!<br/>•    At the start of the tour, make sure your guests understand which way it is when you say “left and right”.<br/><br/><b>2. Describing the destination:</b><br/>- This is the time to use your presentation skill. Present all the facts and information on the history, culture and unique remarks of the visited destination.<br/>- Information will be vary from different places. Therefore, focus on telling your group more about the remarks in each location (some might be the natural history on nature, others might be the interesting customs and traditions of generations of people)<br/>- Giving your group a bit of fun facts is always a great way to engage their attentions and make the trip more memorable.<br/><br/><b>3. Interact with your guests</b><br/>- Speak with moderation to allow some quiet time for your guests to think and process information they’ve received from you.<br/>- Prepare some fun stories and quizzes with wining prizes for everyone in order to encourage interactions among your guests, create a friendship between each other to make the trip more exciting.<br/>- Schedule photo opportunities from times to times to let the group capture their trip.<br/><br/><b>4. Closing Remarks</b><br/>- Inform your group that the tour is going to an end.<br/>- Ask your guests if they have any questions<br/>- Announce the next schedule if applicable<br/>- Remind your passengers to check their belongings before leaving the seats.<br/><br/>For example: Ladies and Gentlemen, we are going to return to the hotel in just a few minutes. Please sit back and enjoy the view as we slowly enter the city. Please remain in your seats until we have arrived at the destination. Our driver will be meeting us at the front entrance to help you with your bags and luggage. Please double check to make sure your bags had been taken off the bus. On behalf of Canary Tour Guides, we hope you have had a wonderful time in Washington D.C and enjoy the rest of your trip.<br/><br/><b>Audio System for Tour Commentary</b><br/>Tour guides working on coaches, boats and cruises will be very familiar with the use of the on-board PA ( Passenger Announcement ) System and its microphone.<br/>- A PA system is basically an audio system of microphone and amplifiers/speakers used to transmit a message to groups of people across a large area.<br/>- Any messages conveyed using a PA system should be brief, informative and relevant. Some issues occurring with PA system might include:<br/>•    Poor quality of the sound sometimes failed to deliver announcements to passengers.<br/>•    Language difficulties, again is sometimes distorted through the PA system.<br/>- Great focus on the content and clarity of the message will reduce passenger confusion and help to generate the information effectively.<br/>- Some automated systems can translate and announce in different languages. This reduces the need for guiding staff to switch languages when making routine commentary. These automated systems are usually based on GPS, prompting the system to generate particular messages are particular points/sights.<br/><br/>The technical tips for using a ‘mic’ are relatively standard:<br/>-    Hold the microphone about 30 centimetres away from your face and speak in a normal tone.<br/>-    Ask your passengers if they can all hear you clearly? If not, try holding the mic closer before raising your voice, but not too close as you may experience a whining noise called ‘feedback’.<br/>-    If possible, turn around to face the group, but safety restrictions on board might mean that you have to sit facing forward.<br/>-    Do your best at projecting your voice, monitor the pitch and speed of your sentences from time to time to make sure your passengers hear you and do not get bored.<br/>-    Some tour buses may feature a wireless microphone or headset, which allows greater movement for the tour guide. These are well worth trying but you may need some practices to perfect the delivery using the headset.<br/></p>	<p>Presentation and commentaries include:<br/>1.    Hold the microphone about 30 centimetres away from your face and speak in a normal tone.  <br/>2.    Welcoming Tourists : Introduce yourself , announce the regular information &amp; requirement of the trip<br/>3.    Describing the visiting destinations<br/>4.    Do your best at projecting your voice, monitor the pitch and speed of your sentences from time to time to make sure your passengers hear you and do not get bored. <br/>5.    Create positive back and forth interactions with your group.<br/>6.    Closing Remarks <br/><br/></p>	https://www.youtube.com/embed/gxloRFhMS7Y	5	1
35	en	<p>Here are some tips and considerations for guiding duties.<br/><br/><b>Front seat or Back seat?</b><br/>- Find the best place to stand that allow you to see all the passengers and vice versa but careful not to obstruct the driver’s view of the road or side mirrors.<br/>- Sitting at the front of the bus allows the tour guide to communicate with the driver on relevant matters. It also enhances the engagement between you and your guests and face-to-face guiding creates a more trusting connection rather than talking from the back.<br/>- The tour guide should stand up from time to time and speak to the group while facing them.<br/>Pace &amp; Delivery on passing through attractions<br/>- At the start of the tour, let your group know which way it is when you say ‘left and right’.<br/>- Be specific with your directions – avoid pointing whilst saying “over there”, but rather ‘to the front and on your left” for example.<br/>- Practice timing the delivery speech – “coming up on the right…” so as the vehicle approaches the sight, passengers will be looking at the right direction. There is nothing that annoys visitors more than being told ‘we just passed the most famous building in the world’ when they didn’t have a chance to see it because you didn’t time the speech right.<br/>- If you can choose the route, choose a circular itinerary so you can circle important streets twice. This will allow visitors on both sides of the vehicle to have a better sight-seeing opportunity.<br/>- Pace the commentary according to the speed of the vehicle and the traffic flow.<br/>- Sometimes there may be nothing interested to see on the road, so tell some funny stories or create quizzes for your group. Alternatively, you can stretch your commentary during the dull phases with stories and anecdotes until there are an interesting sight coming up.<br/>- A guide person must be an excellent story teller, who is able to conjure up images with words and descriptions. It’s also encouraging to add personal comments if you live in the area, engage passengers through words, pictures, and narrations.<br/>- When adding personal comments, if you live in the area being toured, be selective with the stories. (avoid stories related to sensitive issues such as politics, religions, races or genders)<br/>- Do NOT speak non-stop! Aim to speak around 80% of the time and leave some thinking/quiet time for the passengers to chat amongst themselves, and to digest what you have said.<br/>- Avoid using pre-prepared notes as prompters.<br/>- Don’t overly rely the speech on your written notes because it shows an unprofessional attitude and passengers will lose confidence in your knowledge.<br/><br/><b>Delivering Commentaries on Walking Tours</b><br/>If you are tour guiding a walking tour, there are some additional factors to remember:<br/>1. Make sure that the walking pace is appropriate to the group, and to the tour itself. This isn’t a race! The tour guide must always be in the front to lead the tour, and ensure that the group are close behind. Keep an eye out for slow walkers to adjust the pace to suit everyone.<br/>2. It isn’t necessary to talk while walking because you’ll be facing away from the group and they won’t be able to hear you!<br/>3. Limit your formal commentary to moments when you stop walking. Ideally, find a slightly higher area where you can gather the group closely around you in a semi-circle and deliver the commentary.<br/>4. A step or a rock will be okay to stay on. Some guides carry portable steps for this specific purpose.<br/>5. When delivering commentaries outside, you will have to focus on your voice projection so everyone can hear you.<br/>6. When a question is asked, you should repeat the question so the whole group can hear it then answer loud and clear. This will also prevent the same question being asked multiple times!<br/>7. Carry your guide notes with you, but don’t read from them during the tour. They are only for assisting purpose to ensure your speech is delivered thoroughly and in order (you can revise your notes whilst walking/ or in private).<br/>8. The facts and history of the tour are the key parts of the commentary that all tour guides must memorize. How you deliver them is up to you. You may change it from tour to tour.<br/>9. A walking tour should have a conversational quality about it, with the tour guide painting word pictures to describe the attraction and its history.<br/></p>	<p>- The tour guide should stand up from time to time and speak to the group while facing them.<br/>- Be specific with your directions-  At the start of the tour, let your group know which way it is when you say ‘left and right’. <br/>- Pace the commentary according to the speed of the vehicle and the traffic flow.<br/>- Sometimes there may be nothing interested to see on the road, so tell some funny stories or create quizzes for your group<br/>- Avoid stories related to sensitive issues such as politics, religions, races or genders<br/>- Do NOT speak non-stop!<br/>- Avoid using pre-prepared notes as prompters.<br/>- When a question is asked, you should repeat the question so the whole group can hear it then answer loud and clear<br/>- For walking tour , find a slightly higher area where you can gather the group closely around you in a semi-circle and deliver the commentary. <br/></p>	https://www.youtube.com/embed/E5Dt0AxuhB4	4	1
36	en	<p><b>1. Health</b><br/>As a tour guide, you will travel to places via different types of transportation, where the working condition is varying from indoor to outdoor, with the constant changing of climate and weather.

37	en	<p><b>TIPS for a good Presentation</b><br/><br/>During the presentation, you SHOULD:<br/>- Make your commentary interesting, relevant, simple, and deliver it in a logical sequence.<br/>- Be sensitive to the interests of the group to tailor the tour that would suit them best.<br/>- Seek feedback throughout the tour to improve and develop more contents to deliver if needed for your guests.<br/>- Focus on what you and your visitors can see, and on what you know. Be specific, share the facts and paint a word picture about the site or attraction.<br/>- Be flexible and accommodating towards members of your tour group: make sure everybody can hear you, take times to engage with the people at the back, make eyes contact with them and allow the group to question, comment, and actively take part equally during the tour.<br/>- Allow enough time at each stop so the visitors can fully enjoy the tour, digest the information you are sharing, and take photographs etc.<br/>- Anticipate questions from your group, and be ready to share the answers with the whole group as a question from one person might reflect what others in the group are thinking/ or wondering.<br/>- Whilst you may take this tour often and know the commentary well, remember this might be your guests’ first visiting, so keep your content and delivery style up-to-date to ensure you don’t recycle the same old speech over and over.<br/>- Adding new or revised information on the tour, including recent anecdotes or stories, and work towards continuous improvement in your delivery.<br/>- One of the ways, in which good tour guides keep their commentary fresh, is to look at the sight or attraction through the eyes of a new visitor. What would a new visitor like to know about it? Which are the most interesting aspect of it, and how could you tell its story to maintain their engagement throughout the tour?<br/><br/><b>Tactics to keeping the group enthusiastic</b><br/><br/>- Keep the commentary light. People travel for enjoyment so present the facts with a sense of humour. Be witty but also monitor your tone of voice to allow variation and emphasis.<br/>- Keep the narrations positive. Each country or province has problems, but do NOT dwell on them and focus on the positive things instead.<br/>- Personalize the information. Groups are curious about the guide’s personal and professional life. Turn this curiosity to an advantage and weave some personal information in the commentary. Do so moderately.<br/>- Know your audience and involve them. Tailor the information to each particular group. If the group is farmers or accountants, point out sites that they might find most interesting. Schedule and allow many photo opportunities as the tour will allow.<br/>- Be accurate and specific. Present information in an academic manner that is accurate and specific. Quiz the visitors on the commentary to add some entertainment.<br/></p>	<p>TIPS for a good Presentation<br/>-    Make your commentary interesting<br/>-    Focus on what you and your visitors can see,<br/>-    Be specific<br/>-    Be sensitive to the interests of the group<br/>-    Allow enough time at each stop so the visitors can fully enjoy the tour<br/>-    Anticipate questions<br/><br/></p>	https://www.youtube.com/embed/qcPBNn0YoMo	5	1
42	en	<p style="font-size: 14px;"><strong>I. General Information</strong></p><p style="font-size: 14px;"><strong>1. </strong><strong>Introduction</strong></p><p style="font-size: 14px;">Boston is the capital and the largest city of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts in the United States. It is one of the oldest and most historic cities in North America with a very European feel. Boston is extremely diverse with cultures, as well as some of the top universities on the planet – primarily in technology, health care and finance. Boston is a unique city where one must visit when exploring America.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;"><strong>2. History of Foundation</strong></p><p style="font-size: 14px;">Boston was founded on the Shawmut Peninsula in 1630 by Puritan settlers from England. Many of the crucial events of the American Revolution - such as the Boston Massacre, the Boston Tea Party, Paul Reverse’s midnight ride, the battles of Lexington and Concord and Bunker Hill, the Siege of Boston, and many others – occurred in or near Boston. After the Revolution, Boston’s long seafaring tradition helped make it one of the world’s wealthiest international ports, with the slave trade, rum, fish, salt, and tobacco being particularly important.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;">The Embargo Act of 1807, adopted during the Napoleonic Wars, and the War of 1812 significantly curtailed Boston’s harbour activity. Manufacturing became an important component of the city’s economy, and by the mid-19<sup>th</sup> century, the city’s industrial manufacturing overtook international trade in economic importance. Until the early 20<sup>th</sup> century, Boston remained one of the nation’s largest manufacturing centres and was notable for its garment production and leather-goods industries. During this period, Boston flourished culturally as well, admired for its rarefied literary life and generous artistic patronage, with members of old Boston families – eventually dubbed Boston Brahmins – coming to be regarded as the nation’s social and cultural elites.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;">By the early and mid-20<sup>th</sup> century, the city was in decline as factories became old and obsolete, and businesses moved out of the region for cheaper labour elsewhere. Boston responded by initiating various urban renewal projects under the direction of the Boston Redevelopment Authority (BRA), which was established in 1957. However, its extensive demolishing project to improve the historic West End neighbourhood was met with strong public opposition.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;">Boston was an intellectual, technological and political centre but has lost some important regional institutions, including the loss to merges and acquisitions of local financial institution such as FleetBoston Financial in 2004. Boston-based department stores Jordan Marsh and Filene’s have both been merged into the Cincinnati-based Marcy’s.  The city has experienced gentrification in the latter half of the 20<sup>th</sup> century, with housing prices increasing sharply since the 1900s. Living expenses have risen, making Boston one of the highest costs of living in the United States.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;">Boston, however, ranks high on liveability ratings, raking 36<sup>th</sup> worldwide and sitting in the top 3 most liveable large cities in the United States (with San Francisco and Seattle) in 2015.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;"><strong>3. Area &amp; Populations</strong></p><p style="font-size: 14px;">Boston has an area of total 89.6 square miles (232.1 km²). 54% of the city is land and the 46% is of water. The highest point in Boston is Bellevue Hill at 330 feet (100m) above sea level, and the lowest point is at sea level. Situated onshore of the Atlantic Ocean, Boston is the only state capital in the contiguous United States with an oceanic coastline.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;">Boston is surrounded by the “Greater Boston” region and is contiguously bordered by the cities and towns of Winthrop, Revere, Chelsea, Everett, Somerville, Cambridge, Newton, Brookline, Needham, Dedham, Canton, Milton, and Quincy.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;">The iconic Charles River separates Boston from Watertown and the majority of Cambridge, and the mass of Boston from its on Charlestown neighbourhood.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;">Boston is sometimes called a “city of neighbourhood” because the profusion of diverse subsections; the city government’s Office of Neighbourhood Services has officially designated 23 neighbourhoods. More than two-third of inner Boston’s modern land area did not exist when the city was founded, but was created visa the gradual filling in of the surrounding tidal areas over the centuries.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;">Downtown and its immediate surroundings consists largely of low-rise (often Federal style and Greek Revival) masonry buildings, interspersed with modern high-rises, notably in the Financial District, Government Centre, and South Boston. Back Bay includes many prominent landmarks, such as the Boston Public Library, Christian Science Center, Copley Square, Newbury Street, and New England’s two tallest buildings- the John Hancock Tower and the Prudential Center. The South End Historic District is the largest surviving contiguous Victorian-era neighbourhood in the US. The geography of downtown and South Boston was particularly impacted by the Tunnel Project, which allowd for the removal of the unsightly elevated Central Artery and the incorporation of new green spaces and open areas.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;">Boston has a population of approximately 617 600 in 2015, with Caucasian (especially Irish descent) make up 53% of the population, follows by 24% Black, 17% Hispanic or Latino, Asian make up 8% of the total population and the rest is other races – including American Indian and Native Hawaiian Pacific Islander.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;">About 57% of the city’s population identified themselves as Christian, while 33% claim no religious affiliation and the 10% rest follow other religions (including Buddhism, Judaism, Hinduism, and Islam).</p><p style="font-size: 14px;"><strong>4.

You won’t find any “Happy Hour” signs in the local Boston pub because the typical post-work drink deals have been banned since 1984.</li><li>The Fig Newton (a favourite American sweet snack) is actually named after the Boston suburb of Newton, Massachusetts.</li><li>Boston was home to the first U.S chocolate factory, which was built in the Lower Mills section in the Dorchester neighbourhood of Boston.</li><li>Boston built America’s first subway, the Tremont Street Subway, back in 1897.</li><li>Boston was also home to the first public beach in the U.S, which was Revere Beach.</li><li>In 1880, candlepin bowling was invented in Boston. Candlepin bowling is similar to the tenpin bowling most are familiar with, with a few key differences in equipment.</li><li>You can drive 90 feet below the earth’s surface in Boston, as the Ted Williams Tunnel is the deepest in North America, running nearly 90 feet underneath the earth’s surface.</li><li>Christmas was once banned. Bostonians couldn’t celebrate Christmas between 1659 – 1681 because it was against the law as the Pilgrims believed it to be a corrupted holiday.</li><li>The biggest art theft to date occurred in Boston on 18<sup>th</sup> March, 1990. Two thieves posing as cops stole 12 paintings worth a total of $100 million from the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum.</li><li>Bostonians get the weather from a skyscraper: Coloured lights on top of the old John Hancock Tower tell Bostonians the daily weather forecast. The options are solid blue, meaning it’s a clear day; flashing blue, signifying a cloudy day or clouds are comings; solid red, saying there’s rain coming; and flashing red, meaning snow is coming. In the summer, flashing red means the Red Sox game is rained out.</li></ul><p style="font-size: 14px;"><strong>5. Weather</strong></p><p style="font-size: 14px;">Boston has a humid continental climate with some maritime influence. Summers are typically warm to hot, rainy, and humid. The hottest month is July, with a mean temperature of 23 °C (73.4 °F), exceeding to 32 °C (90 °F). Winters oscillate between periods of cold rain and snow, with cold temperature. The coldest month is January, with a mean of -1.7 °C (29 °F), exceeding to -18 °C (0 °F). Spring and fall are usually mild, with varying conditions dependent on wind direction and jet stream positioning. Prevailing wind patterns that blow offshore minimise the influence of the Atlantic Ocean.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;">Fog is fairly common, particularly in spring and summer, and the occasional tropical storm or hurricane can threaten the region, especially in late summer and early autumn. Due to its situation along the North Atlantic, the city of ten receives sea breezes, especially in late spring.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;">Thunderstorms occur from May to September, that are occasionally severe with large hail, damaging winds and heavy downpours. Damaging storms are more common to areas north, west and northwest of the city.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;"><strong>6.

Built by wealthy merchant Peter Faneuil as a centre of commerce in 1741, this is where the Sons of Liberty proclaimed their dissent against Royal oppression.

44	en	<p style="font-size: 14px;"><strong>I. General Information</strong></p><p style="font-size: 14px;"><strong>1. General introduction</strong></p><p style="font-size: 14px;">Los Angeles, LA, has long been associated with sunny days, fit people, relaxing lifestyle, nice beaches, beautiful celebrities and their million dollars’ mansions. LA is the entertainment capital of the world, a cultural mecca boasting more than 100 museums, and a paradise good weather. Los Angeles is on the leading edge of several growth industries. LA County, with more than 87,000 jobs in the fashion industry, has surpassed New York’s fashion district workforce.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;"><strong>2. History of Foundation</strong></p><p style="font-size: 14px;">The history of Los Angeles begins some ten or twenty thousand years before the first Europeans arrived in Southern California. Throughout the vast majority of human history, there was no city of Los Angeles; for thousand years, hunters and gatherers clustered in villages on the shores and the banks of the rivers. Around 1769, when the first Mexican and Spanish settlers arrived, the basin was populated by the Cahuilla, Cupeño, Luiseño, and Serrano, speakers of Takic languages, a branch of Northern Uto-Aztec.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;">A permanent colonial settlement was established on 4<sup>th</sup> September 1781 as El Puelo de Nuestra Señora de Nuestra Señora de los Angeles di Porciúncula. It was named in honour of the shrine to the Virgin Mary, Santa Maria degli Angeli, Our Lady of the Angels, on the plain below Assis, Saint Francis’ native village in Italy. The city was built in land on the Rio Porciúncula, the broad river through the valley, rather than by the ocean, where it would have been too exposed to attacks. It was constructed in the traditional Spanish style, centered around a rectangle consisting of a city plaza, a guardhouse, a town house, and a granary. The invaders set out to reproduce the characteristic Spanish social arrangements and institutions: the missions, the presidios, the divisions between clergy, the army, and the civil populations. Soldiers and adventures, they married the indigenous women, tracking their offspring by degrees of intermarriage. The colonial imperative defined their agendas: the religious conversion of the indigenous people, the attempted pacification of natives’ hostile to colonization, the formation, training, and control of a labor force, and the defense of New Spain achieved its independence from the Spanish Empire in 1821, and the pueblo continued as a part of Mexico. During Mexican rule, Governor Pio Pico made Los Angeles Alta California’s reginal capital.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;">Mexican ruled ended during the Mexican-American War when Americans took control from the Californios after a series of battles, culminating with the singing of the Treaty of Cahuenga on 13<sup>th</sup> January, 1847. Railroads arrived with the completion of the Southern Pacific line to Los Angeles 1876. Oil was discovered in the city and surrounding area in 1892, and by 1923, the discoveries had helped California become the country’s largest oil producer, accounting for about one-quarter of the world’s petroleum output. In 1910, Hollywood merged into Los Angeles, with 10 movie companies already operating in the city at the time. By 1921, more than 80 percent of the world’s film industry was concentrated in L.A. The money generated by the industry kept the city insulted from much of the economic loss suffered by the rest of the country during the Great Depression. By 1930, the population surpassed one million. In 1932, the city hosted the Summer Olympics.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;">During WWII, Los Angeles was a major center of wartime manufacturing, such as shipbuilding and aircraft. Following the end of WWII, Los Angeles grew more rapidly than ever, sprawling into the San Fernando Valley. The expansion of the Interstate Highway System during the 1950s and 1960s helped propel suburban growth and signaled the demise of the city’s electrified rail system, once the world’s largest. </p><p style="font-size: 14px;">In 1984, the city hosted the Summer Olympic Games for the second time. Despite being boycotted by 14 Communist countries, the 1984 Olympics became more financially successful than any previous, and the second Olympics to turn a profit until then – the other, according to an analysis of contemporary newspaper reports, being the 1932 Summer Olympics, also held in Los Angeles.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;">Racial tensions erupted on 29<sup>th</sup> April, 1992, with the acquittal by a Simi Valley jury of the police officers captured on videotape beating Rodney King, culminating in large scale riots. They were the largest riots in US history causing approximately $1.3 billion in damage as well as 53 deaths and over 2,000 injuries.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;"><strong>3. Area &amp; Population</strong></p><p style="font-size: 14px;">The city is divided into over 80 districts, they are divided into the following areas: Downtown Los Angeles, East Los Angeles and Northeast Los Angeles, South Los Angeles, the Harbor Area, Greater Hollywood, Wilshire, the Westside, and the San Fernando and Crescenta Valleys. Los Angeles is divided in five-county area, which are: Los Angeles, Riverside, Ventura, Orange and San Bernardino counties. The city’s street pattern generally follows a grid plan, with uniform block length and occasional roads that cut across blocks. Major streets are designed to move large volume of traffic through many parts of the city; many of them are extremely long. Drivers from LA suffer from one of the worst rush hour periods in the world, according to an annual traffic index by navigation system maker, TomTom as the drivers spend an additional 92 hours in traffic each year.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;">The city of LA covers a total area of 502.7 square miles, comprising 468.7 square miles of land and 34 square miles of water. LA is both flat and hilly. The highest point in the city proper is Mount Lukens (5,074 ft.) located at the northeastern end of the San Fernando Valley. The eastern end of the Santa Monica Mountains stretches from Downtown to the Pacific Ocean and separates the Los Angeles Basin from the San Fernando Valley. Other hilly parts of Los Angeles include the Mt. Washington area north of Downtown, eastern parts such as Boyle Heights, the Crenshaw district around the Baldwin Hills, and the San Pedro district.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;">The United States Census reported that Los Angeles had a population of 18.6 million in 2015. LA is home to people from more than 140 countries speaking 224 different identified languages. The Latino population 47.9%, which make it the largest group in LA. Latino population is spread through the city of Los Angeles and its metropolitan area but it is most heavily concentrated in the East Los Angeles, northeast Los Angeles and northwest Los Angeles regions, which has a long established Mexican-American and Central American community.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;"><strong>4. Facts &amp; Figures</strong></p><ul style="font-size: 14px;"><li>When LA was founded, the city’s full name was “El Pueblo de Nuestra Senora Reina de los Angeles sobre el Rio Porciuncula”, which translates to “The town of our lady queen of the angels on the Porciuncula River”.</li><li>In 1892, oil was discovered near what is now Dodger Stadium.</li><li>By 1923, LA produced one quarter of the world’s oil.

Weather</strong></p><p style="font-size: 14px;">Los Angeles has a dry-summer Mediterranean climate. The city has plenty of sunshine throughout the year, with an average of only 35 days with measurable precipitation annually. Southern California’s climate has often been described as “perfect” with most days are sunny and warm, with gentle ocean breezes in the summer. The humidity is low with little rain.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;">LA is subject to earthquakes because of its location on the Pacific Ring of Fire. The geologic instability has produced numerous faults, which cause approximately 10,000 earthquakes annually in Southern California, though most of them are too small to be felt.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;">Los Angeles suffers from air pollution in the form of smog (smoky fog). The Los Angeles Basin and the San Fernando Valley are susceptible to atmospheric inversion, which holds in the exhausts from road vehicles, airplanes, locomotives, shipping, manufacturing, and other sources. The smog season lasts from May to October. While other cities rely on rain to clear smog, Los Angeles gets only 15 inches of rain each year, pollution accumulates over many consecutive days.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;"><strong>6. Transport</strong></p><ul style="font-size: 14px;"><li><strong>Transit system:</strong> The LA County Metropolitan Authority and other agencies operate an extensive system of bus lines, as well as subway and light rail lines across Los Angeles County. The majority of this is taking up by the bity’s bus system, the second busiest in the country. The subway and light rail combined average the remaining roughly 8.2 million boardings per month.<br/><br/>The city’s subway system is the ninth busiest in the United States and its light rail system is the country’s second busiest. The rail system includes the Red and Purple subway lines, as well as the Gold, Blue, Expo, and Green light rail lines.

Introduction</strong></p><p style="font-size: 14px;">New Orleans is one of the world’s most fascinating cities. It is home to a truly unique melting pot of culture, food and music. Moreover, New Orleans neighborhoods are where the culture and creativity of the Crescent City come to life. From the historic French Quarter to the elegant Garden District to the music-filled Marigny- there is great food, music and more to be found all across the city. Not only that, the city is also famous for its annual celebrations and festivals, most notably Mardi Gras, dating to French colonial times. Maybe that’s why the New Orleans is often referred to as the “most unique” city in the United States.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;"><strong>2. History of Foundation</strong></p><p style="font-size: 14px;">Situated on a bend of the Mississippi River 100 miles from its mouth, New Orleans has been the chief city of Louisiana and the Gulf of Mexico’s busiest northern port since the early 1700s. Founded by the French, ruled for 40 years by the Spanish and bought by the United States in the 1803 Louisiana Purchase, New Orleans is known for its distinct Creole culture and vibrant history.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;">The first known residents of the New Orleans area were the Native Americans of the Woodland and Messapian cultures. The expeditions of De Soto (1542) and La Salle (1682) passed through the area, but there were few permanent white settlers before 1718, when the governor of French Louisiana, Jean-Baptiste Le Moyne, Sieur de Bienville, founded the city of Nouvelle-Orleans on the first crescent of high ground above the Mississippi’s mouth. In 1722 he transferred Louisiana’s capital from Biloxi. The same year a hurricane destroyed most of the new city, which was rebuilt in the grid pattern of today’s French Quarter.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;">In 1762 and 1763 France signed treaties ceding Louisiana to Spain. For 40 years New Orleans was a Spanish city, trading heavily with Cuba and Mexico and adopting the Spanish racial rules that allowed for a class of free people of color. The city was ravaged by fires in 1788 and 1794 and rebuilt in brick with buildings and a cathedral that still stand today. In 1803 Louisiana reverted to the French, Napoléon Bonaparte then sold it to the United States 20 days later in the Louisiana Purchase. The final battle of the War of 1812 was fought in defense of New Orleans; Colonel Andrew Jackson led a coalition of pirates, free blacks and Tennessee Volunteers to defeat a British force outside the city.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;">During the first half of the 19<sup>th</sup> century, New Orleans became the United States’ wealthiest and third-largest city. Its port shipped the produce of much of the nation’s interior to the Caribbean, South America and Europe. Thousands of slaves were sold in its markets, but its free black community thrived. Until 1830, the majority of its residents still spoke French.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;">At the start of the Civil War, New Orleans was the largest city in the Confederacy but it was only a year until Union troops, having captured its downriver defenses, political force, as emancipated slaves and free people of color were brought into the political process and, with the 1870s rise of the White League and the Ku Klux Klan, forced black out of it. Although the rise of railroads made shipping on the Mississippi less essential than it had been, New Orleans remained a powerful and influential port.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;">By 1900, the city’s streetcars were electrified, and New Orleans jazz was born in its clubs and dance halls. They city grew. New pump technology drove the ambitious draining of the low-lying swampland located between the city’s riverside crescent and Lake Pontchartrain. New levees and drainage canals meant that many residents could live below sea level. Hurricanes in 1909, 1915, 1947 and 1965 damaged the city, but never catastrophically.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;">After World War II, suburbanization and conflicts over school integration drew many white residents out of the city, leaving a core that was increasingly African-American and impoverished. Despite these social changes, the city grew as a tourist attraction, with hundreds of thousands of annual visitors drawn to its Mardi Gras festivities and to the culture that had inspired playwright Tennessee Williams, trumpeter Louis Armstrong and chef Jean Galatoire. </p><p style="font-size: 14px;"><strong>3. Area &amp; Population</strong></p><p style="font-size: 14px;">New Orleans is located on the banks of the Mississippi River, approximately 105 miles (169 km) upriver from the Gulf of Mexico. According to the U.S Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 350 square miles (910 km<sup>2</sup>), of which 169 square miles (440 km<sup>2</sup>) is land and 181 square miles (470 km<sup>2</sup>) (52%) is water. Orleans Parish is the smallest parish by land area in Louisiana.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;">The city is located in the Mississippi River Delta on the east and west banks of the Mississippi River and south of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Pontchartrain">Lake Pontchartrain</a>.

Attractions</strong></p><p style="font-size: 14px;"><strong>1. Haunted New Orleans</strong></p><ul style="font-size: 14px;"><li><em><u>The Bourbon Orleans Hotel</u></em>: a notable haunted hotel in the French Quarter. When the building was a convent, the Orleans Ballroom was host to quadroon balls, where men would court local ladies. One ghost is reported to be weeping in the corner for her lover who had promised to marry her but never returned. A male spirit enjoys the company of female visitors, often leaving ladies feeling that the unseen is too close for comfort. The ghosts of children and nuns who perished in a yellow fever epidemic are often seen by guests, particularly the spirit of a little girl rolling her ball down the sixth floor corridor. Additionally, spirits have been known to borrow guests' belongings. One couple received a shock when they found their camera contained pictures of the pair sleeping.</li><li><em><u>Hotel Monteleone</u></em>: While the hotel is most famous for the literary figures it has housed since its establishment in 1886, some of the guests never departed the grand hotel. In March of 2003, the International Society of Paranormal Research made contact with more than a dozen spirits, including a former employee named William Wildmere who died of natural causes in the hotel. Additionally, the spirit of a boy enjoys playing hide-and-seek with another young boy on the fourteenth floor.</li><li><em><u>“Cities of the Dead”:</u></em> Since the city is below sea level and it doesn't take much digging to hit water, New Orleanians bury their dead above ground. These tombs are often lauded for their architecture, but bodies are not all that reside here. Visitors have heard screams coming from inside tombs and seen the ghosts of cats and dogs. Most famously, St. Louis Cemetery No. 1 is home to Marie Laveau's tomb and is considered the most haunted cemetery in the U.S. Marie Laveau herself is rumored to traipse around the graves mumbling a Santeria curse at trespassers. Voodoo legend says to knock three times on the face of Laveau's grave, mark three X's, knock three times again and make a wish to be blessed by Laveau. Don’t forget to leave an offering when you go.</li><li><em><u>Le Petit Theatre</u></em>: America's oldest community theater, is also a haven for the dead. When actors have lost something, they call out to Caroline, one of their most active resident ghosts, asking where it is. When the actors leave the room and return, the item will be sitting in the middle of the floor. An actress who fell from the catwalk onto the stage is sometimes seen up on the catwalk while the curtain billows of its own accord. With 11 confirmed spirits, including ex-managers, Union soldiers and servants, the theater is chilling when the lights dim for a show.</li><li><em><u>Lafitte’s Blacksmith Shop</u></em>: the oldest building used as a bar in the United States, built between 1722 and 1732. Between 1722 and 1791, the building was used as a smuggling post by pirates Jean and Pierre Lafitte and called a &#34;Blacksmith Shop&#34; to avoid suspicion by authorities. With such a storied history, it's no surprise that the bar is one of the most haunted in America. Visitors often report that the fireplace has a pair of glowing red eyes in the grate, and Jean Lafitte himself is rumored to haunt the building. People have seen him sitting at a table in the back of a piano bar, drink in hand.</li></ul><p style="font-size: 14px;"><strong>2. Museums</strong></p><ul style="font-size: 14px;"><li><em><u>Louisiana’s Civil War Museum</u></em>: one of the largest repositories of Confederacy-related artifacts and memorabilia in the United States, in addition to being the oldest continuously operating museum in Louisiana. The Louisiana Historical Association built the museum in 1891, and its exterior sandstone construction and cathedral-like appearance stand out in contrast to its more recent surroundings on the edge of New Orleans’ Warehouse Arts District.</li><li><em><u>The National World War II Museum</u></em>: The country's official World War II Museum lets you experience America's role in the war and on the Home Front - from the 1930s prelude to war, to the Normandy Invasion and the battles of the Pacific Islands. At The US Freedom Pavilion: The Boeing Center, see how technological innovations aided the Allies. Then, with Beyond All Boundaries - a multi-sensory cinematic feature from producer Tom Hanks, playing at the 4D Solomon Victory Theater - feel and experience what soldiers at the front experienced. Through extraordinary artifacts and exhibits, get ready to discover the courage, teamwork and sacrifice of the Greatest Generation.</li><li><em><u>Old U.S Mint</u></em>: Built in 1835, the Old U.S. Mint is the only building in America to have served both as a United States and a Confederate Mint. President Andrew Jackson advocated the Mint’s establishment in order to help finance development of the nation’s western frontier.

49	en	<p style="font-size: 14px;"><strong>I. General Information</strong></p><p style="font-size: 14px;"><strong>1. Introduction</strong></p><p style="font-size: 14px;">San Francisco have taken many visitors’ hearts with its rich culture and fabled nightlife. While the city may not be the nation’s biggest city, it certainly is one of its most cosmopolitan. The iconic Golden Gate Bridge, hilly landscape, year-round fog, cable cars and colourful Victorian houses are all what make San Francisco so wonderfully interesting.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;"><strong>2. History of Foundation</strong></p><p style="font-size: 14px;">The earliest evidence of human habitation of the territory of the city of San Francisco dates to 3000BC, that’s right, about 10,000 years ago. Even before the Pacific waters had breached the span now covered by the Golden Gate Bridge, the Yelamu group of the Ohlone people resided in a few small villages. The city remained untouched by Europeans until 1579 when Sir Francis Drake, the decorated English lotter of Spanish galleons sailed past the entrance of the San Francisco Bay, dubbed a stretch of Marin “Nova Albion” and sailed away.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;">In 1821, Mexico won its independence from Spain, cementing the decline of the mission era. In 1835 an American, William Richardson, became the first permanent resident of Yerba Buena. By the 1840s, dozens more Americans came to Alta California and began agitating for independence. After a briefly declared “California Republic”, they welcomed the arrival of James B. Montgomery, a U.S Navy captain who came ashore on 9<sup>th</sup> July 1846, to raise the U.S flag in Yerba Buena’s plaza (Portsmouth Square today).</p><p style="font-size: 14px;">On 24<sup>th</sup> January 1848, the first gold was found at Sutter’s Fort, in the California foothills. Within months, san Francisco became the central port and depot of the frenzied Gold Rush. Over the next year, arriving “forty-niners” increased the city’s population from 1,000 to 25,000.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;">On 18<sup>th</sup> April 1906, the San Andreas Fault slipped more than 10 feet, unleashing a massive earthquake later estimated at 7.8 on the Richter scale. The tremors broke water mains and triggered fires that raged for four days, killing 3,000 people, destroying 25,000 buildings and leaving 250,000 homeless. The city rebuilt quickly with an improved city centre and hosted the lavish Panama International Exposition just nine years later. The 1930s saw growth both in the city and its outlying communities, and the construction of the iconic Golden Gate and San Francisco Bay Bridges.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;">San Francisco was the main point of embarkation for World War II’s Pacific theatre, and the region became a major arms production centre. After Pearl Harbor, the city’s Japanese residents were forced into internment camps far island. Their abandoned neighbourhood was soon filled by African-Americans arriving from the South to work in the war industries. The city also played a key role in the transition from World War II to the Cold War, hosting the 1954 conference at which the UN Charter was drafted and continuing to draw workers to develop technologies for the nuclear age.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;">San Francisco has maintained its reputation as a centre of cultural bohemianism. In earlier it had drawn writers from Mark Twain to Jack London, and it became a centre for the 1950s beat poets and for the Haight-Ashbury hippie counterculture that peaked with the 1967 “Summer of Love”. On 17<sup>th</sup> October 1989, another large earthquake hit the city, damaging buildings, collapsing freeways and killing 67 people. A decade later, a boom cantered on Internet Technology began, drawing entrepreneurs to the city and raising rents, respectability and resentment in its rougher neighbourhoods. The crowded city’s population, steady for decades, began to rise again.  </p><p style="font-size: 14px;"><strong>3. Area &amp; population</strong></p><p style="font-size: 14px;">San Francisco is located on the West Coast of the United States at the north end of the San Francisco Peninsula and includes significant stretches of the Pacific Ocean and San Francisco Bay within its boundaries. Several picturesque islands – Alcatraz, Treasure Island and the adjacent Yerba Buena Island, and small portions of Alameda Island, Red Rock Island, and Angel Island – are part of the city.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;">The neighbourhood of San Francisco are as diverse as they are fascinating. Whether moving to the Golden Gate City or just trying to get to know its most unique area, below are the neighbourhood guide to the basics of each neighbourhood, outlining the main attractions and some of the more notable hotspot unique to each.</p><ul style="font-size: 14px;"><li><strong>Castro District:</strong> the area historically known as Eureka Valley where working-class Scandinavian and Irish used to reside. Now the universally agreed Mecca of gay life is San Francisco’s Castro District. The affluent North side of Market is home to a predominantly gay and lesbian community, excellent bakeries, boutiques, cafes, restaurants, and of course, gender bending bars. The famed Castro Theatre, the Castro’s historic art deco movie palace, screen old and independent films from around the world. On Halloween, the centre of San Francisco is the Castro, with crowds in the thousands celebrating on the streets.</li><li><strong>The South Market:</strong> was once San Francisco’s industrial core, has been through significant development and is home to new skyscrapers, live-work lofts, and condominiums.</li><li><strong>Fisherman’s Wharf:</strong> popular with tourists and sea lions, the area is full of shops, silly museums and family fun. Still a working wharf, its vendors sell thousands of tons of fish and shellfish. Take an early morning to walk down “Fish Alley” to see fisherman at work. Later, the Wharf is boardwalk-style family entertainment with decidedly attractions such as Ripley’s Believe It or Not! Museum, the Red &amp; White Fleet, the Wax Museum, and the Aquarium. For maritime-lovers and WWII buffs, the San Francisco Maritime Museum is at the foot of Polk St and massive USS Pampanito is docked right at pier 45.</li><li><strong>Financial District:</strong> named for its abundance of modern and historic buildings that house headquarters of corporations like Charles Schwab, Gap Inc., VISA, the 12<sup>th</sup> district of the Federal Reserve and more. Shopping malls like Embarcadero Center, the Ferry Building and Crocker Galleria frequently welcome spree-loving locals and leisure travellers. By virtue of all the businesses in the area, there are also plenty of snazzy little bars where many of the corporate bigwigs have been known to enjoy a martini lunch.</li><li><strong>Mission District:</strong> reputation for hipsters, Latinos, cheap food and drink. The heart of San Francisco’s predominantly Latino neighbourhood is 24<sup>th</sup> Street, a colourful collection of authentic restaurants, tanquerias, Mexican bakeries, produce markets, specialty shops and murals. Mission Dolores at 16<sup>th</sup> and Dolores street is the oldest structure in San Francisco (many of San Fran’s Spanish pioneers are buried on the site) and, two blocks away, on Dolores and 18<sup>th</sup>, the palm tree studded Dolores Park (O’Dolores Beach to sunbathers) still has a Spanish flavour.</li><li><strong>North Beach:</strong> San Francisco’s version of the Red Light District, North Beach at night is a bustling neon home to strip joints, bars, cafes and restaurants. Meander through the streets off Broadway and see how it’s called San Francisco’s “Little Italy”. Like its Italian heritage, this San Fran neighbourhood still holds onto its 1950s Beatnik legacy with the bohemian City Lights Bookstore at the corner of Columbus Ave and Jack Kerouac Alley. Don’t miss Tai Chi nearby Washington Square on weekdays or the North Beach Jazz Festival every August.</li><li><strong>Chinatown:</strong> reputation for exotic, crowded open markets and being the oldest neighbourhood in San Francisco. Enter at “Dragon’s Gate” at Grant Ave and Bush Street. This neighbourhood is packed with Chinese restaurants, shops, temples and street vendors; great for exotic gifts, and fireworks on Lunar New Year.</li><li><strong>SOMA:</strong> San Francisco’s sprawling South of Market District (SOMA) is home to web gurus, urban warriors, offbeat artists, and an unending supply of club kids. This neighbourhood’s industrial, warehouse nature is perfect for the mega clubs and leatherman alike. Dance-hungry hipsters flock to bars like 1015 Folsom and the infamous End Up while risqué gay bars like the Eagle, the Stud and the Hole In the Wall draw a more community more diverse than then queens of the Castro. In the daylight hours, look for substantial San Francisco discount shopping, like cheap fabrics, designer labels and furniture.</li><li><strong>Union Square:</strong> A lone Corinthian column surrounded by newly installed palm tree marks San Fran’s mecca for shopaholics. Ringed by Macy’s, Saks, Neiman Marcus and Levi’s stores along with colourful flower stands and street performers. Surrounding street feature superstores like Virgin Megastore, FAO Schwarz, Gump’s and Britex Fabrics along with boutiques for Coach, Bulgari, Cartier, Thomas Pink, Louis Vuitton, MaxMara, Emporio Armani, Diesel, Prada, Celine, Escada, Gucci, Guess, Hermes, Agnes B., Bestsey Johnson and Wilkes Bashford.</li></ul><p style="font-size: 14px;">The U.S Census 2015 reported that San Francisco had a population of 805,235. With a population density of 12,160 per square mile, San Francisco is the second-most densely populated major American city behind only New York. The city’s demographic is 48.5% non-Hispanic white, 33.3% Asian, Hispanic and Latino makes up 15% of the population, 6% Black or African American, and the below 1% rest is of other races (American Indian, Native Hawaiian Pacific Islander).</p><p style="font-size: 14px;"><strong>4. Fun facts</strong></p><ul style="font-size: 14px;"><li>The Chinese fortune cookie was invented by a Japanese resident of San Francisco</li><li>Irish coffee was perfected and popularised in the City by the Bay</li><li>San Francisco was part of Mexico until the Mexican-American War in 1848.</li><li>During the Depression, not a single San Francisco-based bank failed.</li><li>Business was so good, the city constructed the Oakland bay Bridge and the Golden Gate Bridge during the Depression</li><li>When Al Capone was held at Alcatraz, he gave regular Sunday concerts with the inmate band, the Rock Islanders.

The January 1967 Human Be-In at Golden Gate Park kicked it off.</li><li>Speaking of seasonal confusion, Mark Twain wasn’t as down on San Fran’s weather as some people would have you believe. Twain never uttered the quote “The coldest winter I ever spent was a summer in San Francisco”.</li><li>The neighbourhoods of Marina, Mission Bay, and Hunters Point are all built atop of a landfill.</li><li>The first bubonic plague epidemic in the continental US broke out in SF’s Chinatown in 1900.</li><li>As historical beginnings go, the United Nations Charter was drafted and ratified in San Francisco in 1945.</li><li>The Beatles gave their last full concert at Candlestick Park in 29<sup>th</sup> August, 1966.</li><li>Contemporary reports of the fire note that an unlikely hero helped save the city: Redwood trees.

Weather</strong></p><p style="font-size: 14px;">San Francisco’s climate is characteristic of the cool-summer Mediterranean climate of California’s coast, with moist wild winter and dry summers. San Francisco’s weather is strongly influenced by the cool currents of the Pacific Ocean on the west side of the city, and the water of San Francisco Bay to the north and east. Among U.S cities, San Fran has the coolest daily mean, maximum, and minimum temperature for June, July and August. During the Summer, rising hot air in California’s interior valleys creates a low pressure area that draws winds from the North Pacific High through the Golden Gate, which creates the city’s characteristic cools winds and fog. The fog is less pronounced in eastern neighbourhoods and during the late summer and early fall, which is the warmest time of the year.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;">The dry period of May to October is mild to warm, with the normal monthly mean temperature peaking in September at 62.7 °F (17.1 °C). The rainy period of November to April is slightly cooler, with the normal monthly mean temperature reaching its lowest in January at 51.3 °F (10.7 °C). Snowfall in the city is very rare, with only 10 measurable accumulations recorded since 1852, most recently in 1976 when up to 5 inches (13cm) fell on Twin Peaks.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;"><strong>6. Transportation</strong></p><p style="font-size: 14px;">Due to its unique geography, and the freeway revolts of the late 1950s, San Francisco is one of the few American cities with arterial thoroughfares instead of having numerous highways within the city.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;">Interstate 80 begins at the approach to the Bay Bridge and is the only direct automobile link to the East Bay U.S Route 101 connects to the western terminus of Interstate 80 and provides access to the south of the city along San Francisco Bay toward Silicon Valley. Northward, the routing for U.S 101 uses arterial streets to connect to the Golden Gate Bridge, the only direct automobile link to Marin County and the North Bay.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;">State Route 1 also enters San Francisco from the north via the Golden Gate Bridge and bisects the city as the 19<sup>th</sup> Avenue arterial thoroughfare, joining with the Interstate 280 at the city’s southern border.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;">State Route 35 enters the city from the south as Skyline Boulevard and terminates at its intersection with Highway 1. State Route 82 enters San Francisco from the south as Mission Street, and terminates shortly thereafter at its junction with 280.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;">32% of San Francisco residents use public transportation in daily commuting to work ranking it first on the West Coast and third overall in the United States.</p><ul style="font-size: 14px;"><li><strong>The San Francisco Municipal Railway (known as Muni)</strong> is the primary public transit system of San Francisco. Muni is the seventh-largest transit system in the United States. The system operates both a combined light rail and subway system, the Muni Metro, and a large bus network. Additionally, it runs a historic streetcar line, which designated as a National Historic Landmark to Fisherman’s Wharf. It also operates the famous cable cars, which have been designated as a National Historic Landmark and are a major tourist attraction.<br/><img src="http://cms.canary.dev.exe.com.vn/images/h.png" width="588" height="523"/></li><li><strong>BART:</strong> a regional Rapid Transit system, connects San Francisco with the East Bay through the underwater Transbay Tube. The line runs under Market Street to Civic Center where it turns south to the Mission District, the southern part of the city, and through northern San Mateo County, to the San Francisco International Airport, and Millbrae. Another Commuter Rail system, Caltrain, runs from San Francisco along the San Francisco Peninsula to San Jose. Historically, trains operated by Southern Pacific Lines ran from San Francisco to Los Angeles, via Palo Alto and San Jose.<br/><img src="http://cms.canary.dev.exe.com.vn/images/i.png"/></li></ul><ul style="font-size: 14px;"><li><strong>AMTRAK California Thruway Motorcoach</strong> runs a shuttle bus from San Francisco to its rail station across the Bay in Emeryville. Lines from Emeryville include the Capitol Corridor, San Joaquin, California Zephyr, and Coast Starlight. Thruway service also runs south to San Luis Obispo, California with connection to the Pacific Surfiner.<br/><img src="http://cms.canary.dev.exe.com.vn/images/j.jpg"/></li></ul><ul style="font-size: 14px;"><li><strong>San Francisco Bay Ferry</strong> operates from the Ferry Building and Pier 39 to points in Oakland, Alameda, Bay Farm Island, South San Francisco, and north to Vallejo in Solano County. The Golden Gate Ferry is the other ferry operator with service between San Francisco and Marin County. Soltrans runs supplement bus service between the Ferry Building and Vallejo.</li></ul><p style="font-size: 14px;"><strong>II. Attractions</strong></p><p style="font-size: 14px;"><strong>1. PIER 39:</strong> located in San Francisco’s Fisherman’s Wharf, at Beach Street and The Embarcadero. It is the most visited destination in San Francisco - offers two levels of dining, entertainment, shopping and attractions, all surrounded by unbeatable views of the city and the bay. Located along the Historic San Francisco waterfront, PIER 39’s location provides the picture perfect backdrop for postcard views of the Golden Gate Bridge, Alcatraz, Angel Island and the famous city skyline.</p><ul style="font-size: 14px;"><li>Visit the <strong>Sea Lions</strong>: a crowd of boisterous sea lions who camp out on PIER 39’s K-Dock have been resided there since 1990, arriving in droves shortly after the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake (scientists still aren’t exactly sure why). PIER 39’s Sea Lion Webcam allows you to virtually visit them at your leisure.</li><li>Journey under the <strong>Golden Gate Bridge</strong>: The Golden Gate Bridge is a sight unlike any other, and a must-see for any visitor to San Francisco. Although the most breathtaking angle is one you can only experience by stepping off land and cruising the Bay’s sparkling waters.

Golden Gate Bridge</strong></p><p style="font-size: 14px;">Once called “the bridge that couldn’t be built”, today it is one of the seven wonders of the modern world. This magnificent span, perhaps San Francisco’s most famous landmark, opened in 1937 after a four-year struggle against relentless winds, fog, rock and treacherous tides. The bridge was built at a cost of $35 million in principal and $39 million in interest and 11 worker’s lives. The single-suspension span is anchored by twin towers that reach skyward 746 feet, and was once taller than any building in San Francisco. To support the suspended roadway, two cables, each more than 7,000 feet in length and both containing 80,000 miles of wire stretch over the top of the towers and are rooted in concrete anchorages on shore. More than 10 years in planning due to formidable opposition, but only four years in actual construction, the Golden Gate Bridge brought the communities of San Francisco and Marin counties closer together. Some fun facts about the Golden Gate Bridge:</p><ul style="font-size: 14px;"><li>The Golden Gate Bridge has lost 7,500 tons (in weight) since it opened in 1937</li><li>It is estimated that 5,000 – 10,000 gallons of paint are used to repaint the Golden Gate Bridge each year.</li><li>Three babies have been born on the Golden Gate Bridge. All of them have been boys.</li><li>The name came from the fact that the Golden Gate Strait (named by John Fremont) is the entrance into San Francisco Bay form the Pacific Ocean.</li><li>International Orange was selected as the colour of the bridge because it provided visibility in the fog for passing ships and also because it was a colour that fit in naturally to the bridge’s setting and the surrounding land area.</li><li>The bridge has only been closed three times due to weather since it was built; all three due to high winds gusting close to or over 70 miles per hour.</li></ul><p style="font-size: 14px;"><strong>3. Golden Gate Park:</strong> One of the largest urban parks in the world, Golden Gate Park stretches for three miles on the western edge of San Francisco. There’s not a single “Keep Off the Grass” sign and its 1,017 acres are a tonic for mind and body. Two major museums, splendid gardens and facilities for more than 20 sports confirm that this is a playground in every sense of the world.</p><ul style="font-size: 14px;"><li><strong>The de Young Museum</strong>: a top destination while visiting San Francisco, the de Young museum showcases an extraordinary permanent collection of American art from the 17<sup>th</sup> through 21<sup>st</sup> centuries, modern and contemporary art, photography, international textiles and costumes, and art from Africa, Oceania, and the Americas. The ninth-floor Observation Level of the de Young’s Hamon Tower offers breathtaking 360-degree views of San Francisco and the Pacific Ocean. It closes most Monday and holidays, special exhibition tickets available for additional price.</li><li><strong>California Academy of Sciences</strong>: explore an aquarium, planetarium and natural history museum all under one living roof. A four-story living rainforest and awe-inspiring coral reef ecosystem will delight visitors of all ages, while immersive planetarium shows will transport audience through space and time for a new perspective on our planet.

The museum is also available for special events of up to 3,000 guests.</li><li><strong>Conservatory of Flowers</strong>: Historic San Francisco landmark in Golden Gate Park since 1879 boasting rare tropical flowers and plants from around the world. This gem of Victorian architecture has a long and storied history, and is the oldest public wood-and-glass conservatory in North America. Since re-opening in 2003, the Conservatory has garnered numerous local, state and national awards; as well as a place where horticultural societies, botany students, and young plant enthusiasts gather to study collections and ensure passions for living museums and conservatories will continue to flourish.</li></ul><p style="font-size: 14px;"><strong>4. Lombard Street:</strong> known as the “Crookedest Street in the World”, Lombard Street is one of San Francisco’s most popular landmark. Every year, hundreds of thousands of visitors walk or drive down its eight sharp hairpin turns. Surrounded by Russian Hill mansions and perfectly manicured landscaping and flowers, it is also one of the city’s most scenic streets. Take a spectacular photo at the bottom of the curvy portion looking up or enjoy the breathtaking view from the top looking out onto the San Francisco Bay, the Bay Bridge and Coit Tower. Some fun facts:</p><ul style="font-size: 14px;"><li>Although it is known as the “Crookedest Street in the World”, Lombard Street is not even the “crookedest” street in San Francisco. That title technically belongs to Vermont Street between 20<sup>th</sup> and 22<sup>nd</sup> streets on Potrero Hill.</li><li>It may look treacherous but Lombard Street’s switchbacks were actually built to increase the safety of the street. The natural steep grade of Potrero Hill was thought to be too dangerous. In the 1920s, a property owner suggested a series of switchboards which not only add to the street’s scenic appeal but made it safer for pedestrians.</li><li>The name Lombard actually has no link to San Francisco history. It is named after a street in Philadelphia.</li><li>A race every Easter Sunday where people race big-wheeled plastic bikes, started on Lombard Street before moving to Vermont Street on Potrero Hill, where it takes place now.</li></ul><p style="font-size: 14px;"><strong>5. Alcatraz Island</strong>: Alcatraz was the site of the first lighthouse in the Western United States but became a federal penitentiary from 1934-1963, housing famous convicts such as Al Capone and George “Machine Gun” Kelly. Now this once infamous prison island is part of the Bay Area’s 80,000-acre Golden Gate National Recreation Area. Located one-and-a-half miles from Fisherman’s Wharf, Alcatraz is one of the city’s most popular attractions. A visit to the island includes a tour of the cell house where visitors can see where the prisoners lived. Although the last inmates were transferred off the island in 1963, the main prison block with its steel bars, claustrophobic (9 x 5-foot) cells, messy hall, library and “dark holes”, where recalcitrant languished in inky blackness, is still structurally intact.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;"><strong>6. SFMOMA:</strong> Founded in 1935 as the first West Coast museum devoted to modern and contemporary art, a thoroughly transformed San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, with enhanced gallery, education, and public spaces, opened on May 14, 2016. The Snøhetta-designed expansion, which incorporates the renovated Mario Botta building that opened in 1995, includes 170,000 square feet of new and renovated galleries tailored to the collection, enabling SFMOMA to display more of its outstanding holdings of more than 32,000 modern and contemporary artworks by Alexander Calder, Chuck Close, Frida Kahlo, Jackson Pollock, Gerhard Richter, Richard Serra, Cindy Sherman, and numerous others, along with post-war and contemporary artworks from the renowned Doris and Donald Fisher Collection and an entire floor dedicated solely to photography.

The museum is renowned for its holdings in this area.</li><li><strong>Fifth Floor</strong>: Head straight to the exhibition of pop, minimal and figurative art (also from the Fisher Collection) and sample must-sees by Chuck Close, Roy Lichtenstein, Andy Warhol and Sol LeWitt. Stop for lunch at Café 5 if you feel hungry, choose the table in the rooftop sculpture garden.</li><li><strong>Fourth Floor:</strong> Find your way to the glorious Ellsworth Kelly galleries. They span all stages of the artist’s career, like a mini survey, and are guaranteed to lift your spirits. Then bliss out in the secluded, octagonal-shaped “chapel” of seven paintings by Agnes Martin.</li><li><strong>Third Floor:</strong> This level is largely devoted to <a href="http://www.sftravel.com/article/5-picture-perfect-destinations-photography-lover">photography</a>, one of SFMOMA’s great points of distinction. But on a tight schedule you may have to save that for another time. Instead check out the delightful Alexander Calder “motion lab” (on view through Sept. 17, 2017) and experience a concentration of the artist’s mobiles that extends into an outdoor terrace framed by a gigantic vertical garden. Indoor-outdoor visitor circulation creates airflow into these galleries, which allows the sculptures to do their thing. Then get your afternoon caffeine fix at the new Sightglass coffee bar. </li><li><strong>Second Floor:</strong> You must at least whiz through SFMOMA’s re-envisioned permanent collection galleries, stopping to say hello to greatest hits like Matisse’s <em>Femme au Chapeau</em> and Mark Rothko’s luminous <em>14, 1960, </em>among other old friends like Frida Kahlo’s self-portrait with hubby Diego Rivera and important works by Robert Rauschenberg (another great strength of the collection). Grab a souvenir from the new Museum Store outpost in the ticketing court where you started.</li><li><strong>Ground Floor:</strong> Grab a souvenir from the new Museum Store outpost in the ticketing court where you started, then (literally) wind your way through Richard Serra’s behemoth walk-in sculpture <em>Sequence</em> and out the door of SFMOMA’s new glass-walled gallery facing Howard Street.</li></ul><p style="font-size: 14px;"><strong>7.

Forbes Island (PIER 39):</strong> this restaurant is on an island (a manmade one, but still, it’s an <a href="http://www.sanfrancisco.travel/article/islands-san-francisco-bay">island in San Francisco Bay</a>).

Unlike some newer restaurants that have a highly edited menu, Kokkari’s offerings are extensive and mouthwatering.

Michael Mina and chef Ken Tominaga’s buzzy, sleek and happening restaurant is a stunning modern izakaya on California Street near the cable car turnaround. There are several private rooms and booths, as well as a chef’s counter where diners can watch the sushi chefs filet fresh toro and season it ever so slightly with smoke or salt to make the most delectable bites of sashimi around. There is also finger-licking good robata skewers of chicken tail or pork belly, soothing miso soup with silken tofu, and American wagyu beef shabu shabu. On weekend nights the crowds can be a little loud, so if you’re hosting an event on the company dime on Friday or Saturday, it might be worth booking a private room.</li><li><strong><u>Q (1085 Mission St):</u></strong> A.Q is elegant with wood tables topped with seasonal décor. In fact, everything about A.Q. is a celebration of the current season: the decor, the cocktails, the food and even the website are inspired by spring, summer, autumn or winter. It makes A.Q. a fun restaurant to visit throughout the year, as each time you go, the menu, look and feel is completely different. There are two options to enjoying the upscale California cuisine: a four-course prix fixe menu or a chef’s tasting menu. Either are scrumptious choices and do splurge on the innovative beverage pairing—it's definitely worth it!</li></ul><p style="font-size: 14px;"><strong>b.

That enterprise evolved into an oyster saloon. During Prohibition in the 1920s, an owner named Sam stepped into the picture. He experimented with a re-branding using his and his partner's surnames. Zembolich &amp; Zenovich was short-lived (surprised?), so Sam’s Grill stuck. Sam’s Grill has hosted special moments and whispered secrets for 150 years. Much-loved for a classic Old Fashioned and the freshest daily market fish, Sam’s owners have preserved the timeless look and feel of the place. You can even draw the curtains at your private, cosy dining booth where a bell will summon your waiter. </li><li><strong><u>Cliff House (1090 Point Lobos Ave.):</u> </strong>Once host to presidents and wealthy Victorian society, the oceanfront destination alternatively went through periods of popularity among high life and riff-raff.

Later, it was the centerpiece of a fabled 10-acre amusement park attracting thousands weekly. Although this place with an 1863 birth certificate survived earthquakes, it suffered destruction by fire twice, including an 1887 explosion aboard an offshore schooner wreck. Cliff House started all over again each time in the same Lands’ End spot. the Cliff House has a live webcam and a website noting the time of sunset, so guests can perfectly time a visit.

Initially, its purpose was to train dancers to appear in opera productions, but it separated from the opera in 1942 and was renamed SF Ballet. Headed by brothers <a href="https://www.sfballet.org/planyourvisit/learn/christensen_brothers#harold">Willam</a>, <a href="https://www.sfballet.org/planyourvisit/learn/christensen_brothers#lew">Lew</a>, and <a href="https://www.sfballet.org/planyourvisit/learn/christensen_brothers#harold">Harold</a> Christensen from the late ’30s until the ’70s, it made its mark early on by staging the first full-length American productions of <em>Swan Lake</em> (1940) and <em>Nutcracker </em>(1944)<em>. </em>Under Lew’s direction, the Company made its East Coast debut at Jacob’s Pillow Dance Festival in 1956 and toured 11 Asian nations the following year, marking the first performances of an American ballet company in the Far East.

Must-try San Francisco Invented Cocktails:</strong></p><p style="font-size: 14px;"><strong>a. Cable Car:</strong> created in 1996 by Tony Abou-Ganim at the <a href="http://www.sftravel.com/explore/hotels/sir-francis-drake-hotel">Sir Francis Drake’s</a> <a href="http://www.sftravel.com/explore/nightlife/starlight-room">Starlight Room</a>. It’s an intriguing little twist on the classic sidecar that swaps the original’s cognac for Captain Morgan’s spiced rum, but keeps the orange liqueur and lemon juice. It also adds a cinnamon sugar rim as a garnish, adding to the spice profile of the cocktail.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;"><strong>b. California Milk Punch:</strong> invented by the famous Jerry Thomas during his stint in San Francisco, and uses ingredients as eclectic as the city itself, including lemon, pineapple, green tea, brandy, Jamaican rum, cloves, coriander, cinnamon, and of course milk. The idea behind this milk punch is to curdle the milk and then strain the solids, leaving behind all the nasty particulates, and resulting in a creamy, preservable drink ready for bottling.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;"><strong>c. Pisco Punch:</strong> Pisco (which is distilled from Peruvian grape varietals) made its way up to the city from Peru via traders in the 1830s. When the Bank Exchange &amp; Billiard Saloon opened in 1853, it was only natural that they would offer a variety of punches, and the availability of pisco made it a perfect candidate. Duncan Nicol is credited with the original recipe, with pisco, pineapple, lime juice, gum arabic, and water, which was described at the time as “like lemonade but comes back with the kick of a roped steer.”</p><p style="font-size: 14px;"><strong>d. Martini:</strong> After a rough decade being transmogrified into a plethora of sickly sweet ‘tinis, the “only American invention as perfect as a sonnet” is finally experiencing a glorious comeback. First things first: a martini is made with gin, not vodka. It traces its roots to the classic Martinez (which allegedly was invented just up the bay in the city of the same name) which called for gin, vermouth, and maraschino liqueur. Sometime in the 1860s, the Occidental Hotel in San Francisco dropped the liqueur from the recipe, and the martini was born.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;"><strong>3. Winery:</strong></p><p style="font-size: 14px;"><strong>a. Bluxome Street Winery (53 Bluxome St.):</strong> you’ll get a taste of wine and San Francisco history. A reel of old video footage shows San Francisco around the turn of the century (19th to 20th) and those behind the bar can tell you a few things about the area formerly known as “South of the Slot” before it became “SOMA.” Mostly though, there’s a slough of Russian River wines with Pinot Noir being the focus.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;"><strong>b. Chateau Montelena (335 Powell St.):</strong> Chateau Montelena itself is a California landmark and if you can make it up to the winery that is preferable but if not, just step into the Westin St. Francis on Union Square and check out the tasting room in the lobby. The standards are always open and usually there is also a special wine or two being poured.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;"><strong>c. Jax Vineyards and Tasting Room (326 Brannan St.):</strong> The first Jax wine was made in a San Francisco garage so it makes complete sense that this family owned and run winery would choose to set up shop within the city’s borders. They started out working with the Bordeaux varieties from their home vineyard in Calistoga but have since branched out to make other wines sourcing fruit from other parts of Napa and Sonoma.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;"><strong>d. Wattle Creek Winery (900 North Point St.):</strong> Located in the Alexander Valley an hour and a half north of San Francisco, without traffic, Wattle Creek serves up a selection of wines from their estate vineyard. There is a good variety of wines to choose from so no matter what your taste, or how many in your party, everyone should discover something that fits their palate.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;"><strong>e. Winery Collective (495 Jefferson St.):</strong> Over a dozen wineries are represented at this outpost in Fisherman’s Wharf with a narrower range poured by the glass. Three flights are offered starting with the introductory Locals Flight to the more complex “Urban Flight.” There are also ten wines poured by the glass selected from the members of the collective.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;"><strong>4. Bars at SOMA:</strong></p><p style="font-size: 14px;"><strong>a. Alchemist Bar &amp; lounge (679 3<sup>rd</sup>):</strong> Alchemist is tucked away on the second floor of a building around the corner from the ballpark. This makes it feel a little bit like a speakeasy and the Steampunk décor promotes that. The space has a loft-like feel, which will make you feel even more as if you stumbled into someone’s private party. Swanky as the Alchemist might be, this place is very serious about its cocktails. Ingredients are sourced from Chinese herbalists and artisan purveyors.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;"><strong>b. Dirty Water (1355 Market St.):</strong> on the ground floor of the Twitter building, across from The Market, San Francisco’s latest gourmet epicenter. The space is open and industrial and it looks great during the day or when the sun goes down. And this is perfect as there are so many delicious drinks offered that you might want to make your choice based on the time of day: vodka in the afternoon, whiskey at night. Or not. Although it is still very new to San Francisco, Dirty Water has nailed its cocktail program and also has an extensive cheese selection and small plates, so be prepared for a long hang out, possibly from day into night.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;"><strong>c. Monarch (101 6<sup>th</sup>):</strong> Upstairs, Monarch is a bar and one of the most stylish you’ll find in SOMA with plenty of throwback pieces from different eras that seamlessly match. There are a few little nooks for chats with friends but the place has a lively vibe. And, if lively is what you want, check out the downstairs club featuring popular DJ’s most nights. Not least, the drinks are killer with several original cocktails such as the Monkey Wrench, a tequila based cocktail that goes down way too easily. However, you can order a Jack and Coke without getting any “holier than thou” attitude from the bartenders. It’s the real deal and there are “Amazing Hour” drink specials 5:30–7:30, with various forms of entertainment and festivities.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;">Reference:</p><p style="font-size: 14px;"><a href="http://www.sftravel.com/">http://www.sftravel.com</a></p><p style="font-size: 14px;"><a href="http://www.sanfrancisco.com/">http://www.sanfrancisco.com</a></p>	<p>1.

47	en	<p style="font-size: 14px;"><strong>I. General Information:</strong></p><p style="font-size: 14px;"><strong>1. General Introduction about the City:</strong></p><p style="font-size: 14px;">New York, New York, a city that never sleeps. Home to the Empire State Building, Times Squares, Statue of Liberty and so much more other iconic sites, the infamous New York city is a fast-paced, globally influential centre of art, culture, fashion and finance. The city of 5 boroughs site where the Hudson River meets the Atlantic Ocean, with the island borough of Manhattan at the “Big Apple’s” core. New York city is a glamorous city where people around the world arrive every year to make their dreams come true.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;"><strong>2. History of foundation:</strong></p><p style="font-size: 14px;">In 1785, the assembly of the Congress of the Confederation made New York the national capital shortly after the war. New York was the last capital of the U.S under the Articles of Confederation and the first capital under the Constitution of the United States. In 1789, the first President of the United States, George Washington was inaugurated; the first United States Congress and the Supreme Court of the United States each assembled for the first time, and the United States Bill of Rights was drafted, all the Federal Hall on Wall Street. By 1790, New York had surpassed Philadelphia as the largest city in the United States.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;">The Great Irish Famine brought a large influx of over 200,00 Irish immigrants living in New York by 1860, upwards of a quarter of the city’s population. There was also extensive immigration from the German province, where revolutions had disrupted societies, and German comprised another 25% of New York’s population in 1860.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;">In 1898, the modern City of New York was formed with the consolidation of Brooklyn (until then a separate city), the County of New York (which then included parts of the Bronx), the County of Richmond, and the western portion of the County of Queens. The opening of the subway in 1904, first built as separate private systems, helped bind the new city together. Throughout the first half of the 20<sup>th</sup> century, the city became a world centre for industry, commerce, and communication.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;">New York became the most populous urbanised area in the world in early 1920s, overtaking London. The metropolitan area surpassed the 10 million mark in the early 1930s, becoming the first megacity in human history. After World War II, New York emerged as the leading city of the world, with Wall Street leading America’s place as the world’s dominant economic power. The United Nations Headquarters was completed in 1952, solidifying New York’s global geopolitical influence, and the rise of abstract expressionism in the city precipitated New York’s displacement of Paris as the centre of the art world.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;">The city and surrounding area suffered the bulk of economic damage and largest loss of human life in the tragic aftermath of the September 11<sup>th</sup>, 2001 attacks when the terrorist members of Al-Qaeda piloted American Airlines Flight 11 into North Tower of the World Trade Centre and United Airlines Flight 175 into the South Tower of the World Trade Centre, and later destroyed them, killing 2,192 civilians, 343 firefighters, and 71 law enforcement officers who were in the towers and the surrounding area. The rebuilding of the area, has created a new One World Trade Centre, and a 9/11 memorial and museum along with other new buildings and infrastructure. The new One World Trade Centre is the tallest skyscraper in the Western Hemisphere and the fourth-tallest building in the world by pinnacle height, with its spire reaching a symbolic 1,776 feet (541.3m) in reference to the year of American independence. </p><p style="font-size: 14px;"><strong>3. Area &amp; Population:</strong></p><p style="font-size: 14px;">New York city is situated in the Northeastern United States, approximately halfway between Washington D.C and Boston. The location at the mouth of the Hudson River, which feeds into a naturally sheltered harbour and the into the Atlantic Ocean, has helped the city grow in significance as a trading port. Most of New York City is built on the three islands of Long Island, Manhattan, and Staten Island.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;">New York City is composed of five boroughs:</p><ul style="font-size: 14px;"><li><strong><u>Manhattan (New York County)</u></strong> is the geographically smallest and most densely populated borough. The islands are linked by bridges, tunnels and ferries. Manhattan is 13.4 miles long and 2.3 miles wide at its widest. Fifth Avenue divides the island into east and west sides. Manhattan’s population density of 72,033 people per square mile (27,812/km²) in 2015 makes it the highest of any county in the United States and higher than the density of any individual American city. Manhattan is the cultural, administrative, and financial centre of New York City and contains the headquarters of many major multinational corporations, the United Nations Headquarters, Wall Street, and a number of important universities. Manhattan is often described as the financial and cultural centre of the world.</li><li><strong><u>Brooklyn (Kings County):</u></strong> on the western tip of Long Island, is the city’s most populous borough. Brooklyn is known for its cultural, social, and ethnic diversity, an independent art scene, distinct neighbourhoods, and a distinctive architectural heritage. Downtown Brooklyn is the only central core neighbourhood in the outer borough. The borough has a long beachfront shoreline including Coney Island, established in the 1870s as one of the earliest amusement grounds in the city. Marine Park and prospect Park are the two largest parks in Brooklyn.</li><li><strong><u>Queens (Queens County):</u></strong> on Long Island north and east of Brooklyn, is geographically the largest borough, the most ethnicity diverse county in the United States, as well as the most ethnically diverse urban area in the world. Historically a collection of small towns and villages founded by the Dutch, the borough has since developed both commercial and residential prominence. Queens is the site of Citi Field, the baseball stadium of the New York Mets, and hosts the annual U.S Open tennis tournament at Flushing Meadows-Corona Park. Additionally, two of the three busiest airports serving the New York metropolitan area, John F. Kennedy International Airport and LaGuardia Airport, are located in Queens. (the third is Newark Liberty International Airport in Newark, New Jersey).</li><li><strong><u>Staten Island (Richmond County)</u></strong> is the most suburban in character of the five borough. Staten Island is connected to Brooklyn by the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge and to Manhattan by way of the free Staten Island Ferry, a daily commuter ferry and popular tourist attraction which provides unobstructed views of the Statue of Liberty, Ellis Island, and Lower Manhattan. In central Staten Island, the Staten Island Greenbelt spans approximately 2,500 acres (10 km²), including 28 miles (45 km) of walking trails and one of the last undisturbed forests in the city. Designated in 1894 to protect the island’s natural lands, the Greenbelt comprises seven city parks.</li><li><strong><u>The Bronx (Bronx County):</u></strong> is New York City’s northernmost borough and the only New York borough with a majority of it a part of the mainland Unites States. It is the location of Yankee Stadium, the baseball park of the New York Yankees, and home to the largest cooperatively owned house complex in the United States, Co-op City. It is also home to the Bronx Zoo, the world’s largest metropolitan zoo, which spans 265 acres (1.09 km²) and houses over 6,000 animals. The Bronx is also the birthplace of rap and hip hop culture. Pelham Bay Park is the largest park in New York City, at 2765 acres (1119 ha)</li></ul><p style="font-size: 14px;">The city population in total is estimated to be around 8.5 billion in 2015</p><p style="font-size: 14px;"><strong>4. Facts &amp; Figures:</strong></p><ul style="font-size: 14px;"><li>New York is nicknamed as The Big Apple. In the early 1920s, “apple” was used in reference to the many horse racing courses in and around New York City. Apple referred to the prizes being awarded for the races (possibly due to the fact that horses like apples) as these were important races, the rewards were substantial. A writer of the New York Morning Telegraph, John Fitzgerald, referred to New York City’s races “Around the Big Apple”. It is rumoured that Fitzgerald got the term from jockeys and trainers in New Orleans who aspired to race on New York City tracks, referring to the “Big Apple”.</li><li>Except for emergencies, honking your car is actually illegal in New York City, and yes, everybody does it anyway.</li><li>Manhattan was purchased from the native people in 1626 for the modern equivalent of 1000USD</li><li>It can cost nearly $300,000 to operate a hot dog stand around Central Park. (maybe that’s why) New Yorkers bite 10 times more people per year than sharks do.</li><li>New York City doesn’t have any Walmart’s.</li><li>More Chinese people live in New York City than any other city outside of Asia. And more Jewish people live there than any other city outside of Israel.</li><li>25% of the world’s gold bullion is stored in vaults under Wall Street (the Federal Reserve Bank)</li><li>1 out of every 21 New Yorker is a millionaire</li><li>With over 800 languages spoken by a significant portion of the population, New York City is the most linguistically diverse city in the world.</li><li>The Empire State Building has its own zip code.</li><li>Einstein’s eyeballs are locked in a safe deposit box somewhere in the city.</li><li>The city gets about 15 times more snow than the South Pole every year (because Antarctica is a desert and therefore receives very little precipitation).</li><li>New York’s Central Park is larger than the principality of Monaco.</li><li>Annual location shots on the streets on New York number 40,000 – including commercials, feature films, television shows and series, music videos and documentaries.</li><li>The Manhattan grid pattern produces an effect known as “Manhattanhenge” (like Stonehenge) as, on two days – around 28<sup>th</sup> May and around 12<sup>th</sup> July – sunset is directly aligned with the street grid pattern. (This means the sun can be seen setting exactly over the centreline of every Manhattan street).</li></ul><p style="font-size: 14px;"><strong>5. Weather</strong></p><p style="font-size: 14px;">New York City features a humid subtropical climate. The city weather can vary from day to day, and even hour to hour, but a guide to the seasons can help you plan your wardrobe. More generally, spring in New York City brings budding flowers, light winds and rain, with the season’s temperature ranging from chilly to warm. Winter are cold and damp, and prevailing wind patterns that blow offshore minimize the moderating effects of the Atlantic Ocean; yet the Atlantic and the partial shielding from colder air by the Appalachians keep the city warmer in the winder than inland North American cities. January is the coldest month with temperature ranging from 32.6 ᵒF (0.3 ᵒC) to 10 ᵒF (-12 ᵒC). Summers are typically warm to hot and humid, with a daily mean temperature of 76.5 ᵒF (24.7 ᵒC) to 90 – 100 ᵒF (32 – 38 ᵒC) in July.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;"><strong>6. Transportation</strong></p><p style="font-size: 14px;">New York is an excellent walking city, and getting around by foot is the best way to familiarise yourself with neighbourhoods and their divisions. Of course, sometimes you’ll need to move more quickly or cover great distances, for which you’ve got subways, buses and taxis at your disposal</p><ul style="font-size: 14px;"><li><strong><u>Subways</u>:</strong> subway trains operate 24 hours a day, seven days a week. For $2.75 (the cost of a single ride when using a pay-per-ride MetroCard), you can use the system citywide and transfer to other subway lines as many times as you need, as long as you don’t exit the system through a turnstile. You can also transfer from bus to subway or vice versa within two hours of using your MetroCard. The subway however does not travel to Staten Island. To get there, board the free Staten Island Ferry or take a bus.<br/><img src="http://cms.canary.dev.exe.com.vn/images/f.jpg"/></li><li><strong><u>The Roosevelt Island Tram</u>:</strong> with the swipe of a MetroCard, the Roosevelt Island Tram gives you an aerial view of Midtown East along its path from 59<sup>th</sup> Street and Second Avenue in Manhattan to Roosevelt Island, located in the East River between Manhattan and Queens. The Tram got its start in the early 1900s, taking passengers halfway across the Queensboro Ridge, where an elevator would then transport them down the island.</li><li><strong><u>Bike</u>:</strong> plenty of operations rent bikes by the half day and full day, with many such places located near the major biking destinations.</li><li><strong><u>Ferry</u>:</strong><ul><li><strong>The Staten Island Ferry</strong> takes you on the route between Staten Island and Manhattan’s Whitehall Ferry Terminal where you can enjoy the great views of the Statue of Liberty, New York Harbour and Lower Manhattan on the 25 minutes’ free mini cruise.</li><li><strong>New York Water Taxi:</strong> another popular aquatic shuttle that takes you to Pier 84 (at 44<sup>th</sup> Street), Christopher Street, the World Financial Centre and Pier 1 in DUMBO.</li><li><strong>NY Waterway:</strong> operates commuter ferries between points in Manhattan and New Jersey, and harbour and sightseeing cruises. The East River Ferry also provides a refreshing alternative to more traditional public transportation in the City with regular service to seven locations across the three boroughs.</li></ul></li><li><strong><u>Taxi</u>:</strong> yellow taxicabs and green Boro Taxis is regulated by the Taxi and Limousine Commission.

Tip 15-20% at the end of a trip; tolls are extra and added to the metered fare.</li><li><strong><u>Helicopter</u>:</strong> seeing New York by air is an unforgettable experience. <em>Liberty Helicopters</em> (800-542-9933) runs several tours of the City; <em>Helicopter Flight Services, Inc</em>. (212-355-0801) will personalise sightseeing tours and charters; and <em>New York Helicopter Charter, Inc.</em> (212-361-606) allows you to choose from three options: the Liberty Tour, the Central Park Tour, and the Grand Tour, which combines the first two tours and also flies over many other essential NYC attractions.</li></ul><p style="font-size: 14px;"><strong>II. Attractions:</strong></p><ul style="font-size: 14px;"><li><strong><u>Empire State Building</u>:</strong> located in the heart of Midtown Manhattan where you will have a journey through one of the most famous landmarks in the world, where you will experience the Art Deco lobby and murals, the historical “Dare to Dream” exhibit, and sustainability exhibit. On the 102<sup>nd</sup> floor, the Empire State Building’s Top Deck gives you the most spectacular views of the city and beyond. Central Park comes into full view, the grid of streets reveals its brilliant design, and on a clear day you can see beyond the skyscrapers up to 80 miles away.</li><li><strong><u>One World Observatory</u>:</strong> located in One World Trade Centre, the tallest building in the western hemisphere. The only one way to truly see the whole glamourous New York and look toward the horizon while enjoying some snacks and lighter fare at the three restaurants on the 101<sup>st</sup></li><li><strong><u>Times Square:</u></strong> Flashing neon lights and giant digital billboards. Brilliant Broadway marquees. Costumed characters and musicians. Time Square is big, bright and unforgettable. Its main junction is filled with popular retailers-plus the TKTS discount booth, which offers up to 50% off theatre tickets. Walk to the top of its red steps-you may know them from the “Empire State of Mind” video-for a sweeping view of the area, including One Times Square, the building from which the ball drops on New Year’s Eve. People-watchers will love the pedestrian-only zone furnished with tables and chairs.</li><li><strong><u>Broadway</u>:</strong> the bright beating heart of NYC’s performing arts scene. No visit to the City is complete without experiencing the rousing entertainment available in Midtown Manhattan’s Theatre District, where dozens of historic venues stage bold new musicals, long-running hits and fascinating dramas every night of the week.</li><li><strong><u>Central Park:</u></strong> the largest in Manhattan and without a doubt the most famous in all of NYC. Established in 1857, the 843-acre oasis has served as the scenic backdrop in countless movies and TV shows and functions as a kind of all-encompassing public recreation area. Its many attractions include a zoo, an ice-skating rink, a concert venue and several restaurants-not to mention its open fields, woodlands, running paths and various bodies of water. Located in the middle of Manhattan, the park, as its name suggests, is at the centre of it all.</li><li><strong><u>The Met:</u></strong> on Fifth Avenue is one of NYC’s most beloved cultural institutions. Housing nearly 2 million works of art, the Met is the largest museum in the US-and among the largest on earth. On a single day, you can see painting by Van Gogh and Rembrandt; 17<sup>th</sup> century Portuguese king’s armour; ancient tapestries depicting Buddhist deities; and the Temple of Dendur, an Egyptian shrine built about 15 BC. You will also find galleries of Asian, Egyptian and Islamic art, which reveal the influences and intersections of the world’s many cultures. In addition to the Met’s main building on Fifth Avenue, the institution includes the Met Cloisters, dedicated to the art and architecture of medieval Europe, and the Met Beuer, featuring modern and contemporary collections.</li><li><strong><u>The Museum of Modern Art (MoMA):</u></strong> not only devoted to presenting the best in contemporary art, but also to promoting the understanding of modern art and expanding the definition of what is considered “art” in the first place. See boundary-pushing modern work from the likes of Frida Kahlo, Andy Warhol, Pablo Picasso, Claude Monet and Vincent van Gosh (whose Starry Night is pictured here).</li><li><strong><u>The Whitney Museum of American Art</u>:</strong> the world’s leading museum of 20<sup>th</sup> century and contemporary art of the United States. Focusing particularly on works by living artist, the Whitney is celebrated for presenting important exhibitions and for its renowned collection, which comprises over 19,000 works by more than 2,900 artists. With a history of exhibiting the most promising and influential artists and provoking intense debate, the Whitney Biennial, the museum’s signature exhibition, has become the most important survey of the state of contemporary art in the United States.</li><li><strong><u>Rockefeller Centre:</u></strong> A visit to New York City wouldn’t be complete without a trip to Rockefeller Plaza, where skaters glide across the rink and thousands of lights gleam from the always-enormous Christmas tree in the winter, and outdoor dining options abound in the warmer months. No matter the season, come for the shops (from the FDNY Fire Zone store and museum to Swarovski), the eats (from Dean &amp; DeLuca to Mendy’s Kosher Deli) and the stargazing here in NBC Studios’ backyard. The three observation decks at Top of the Rock showcase the City’s spectacular skyline.</li><li><strong><u>Patrick’s Cathedral:</u></strong> holds its own among Midtown’s tall building and historic architecture, its twin spires jutting 330 feet up toward the heavens. Fresh off a $177 million restoration-which cleaned those spires as well as the heavy bronze doors, ceiling, stained glass and enormous pipe organ-the Neo-Gothic church is among NYC’s most-visited religious sites; in fact, it’s among the City’s most-visited attractions period, welcoming an estimated 5 million people every year. On 24<sup>th</sup> September a very special guest will be among those annual arrivals: Pope Francis will preside over a private vespers prayer service, becoming the fourth pontiff to visit the cathedral. Spanning the length of an entire City block, the building itself is made of brick but entirely overlaid in marble. There’s much to see once you pass through the bronze doors and stand under the vaulted ceiling, including a giant organ with 7,855 pipes, a becy of stained-glass windows, more than 20 altars-two of which were designed by Tiffany &amp; Co. – and a marble Stations of the Cross, which won recognition at the 1893 World’s Fair in Chicago.</li><li><strong><u>The Statue of Liberty:</u></strong> was a gift from France to the United States as a token of goodwill for America’s centennial of independence (and to send a message to France’s oppressive Second Empire). Historian Edouard de Laboulaye first proposed the idea in 1865, shortly after the Union won the American Civil War. He then teamed up with French sculptor Frederic Auguste Bartholdi, an admirer of the US, democracy and colossal monuments. When design Liberty Enlightening the World (the statue’s official name), the duo were careful not to make Liberty appear to be “leading an uprising” but rather “lighting the way, peacefully and lawfully”, according to park service literature. They started construction in Paris in 1875 and shipped the completed pieces 10 years later, in 1885. On 28<sup>th</sup> October 1886, a million New Yorkers cheered the official dedication. Since then, the statue has been a symbol of freedom, justice and opportunity for those who come to New York City and America.</li><li><strong><u>Yankee Stadium</u>:</strong> the home of the New York Yankees is one of the City’s most beloved sports sites. The team’s current address preserves many of the design details that defined the original place- The House That Ruth Built-where the baseball team played from 1923 until the new version opened for the 2009 season. The outfield stands still feature the Bleacher Creatures (very loud, very dedicated fans), but now there are fancy suites, a wider variety of concessions and a state-of-the-art video board. The stadium is also home to the New York City Football Club (soccer) and sometimes hosts other big events like concerts.</li><li><strong><u>Madison Square Garden:</u></strong> The Garden is the city’s premiere sports and entertainment complex, home to the New York Rangers, Knicks and Liberty teams, as well as the stage for massively popular artists like Tina Turner, AC/DC and Oasis. The more intimate Theatre at Madison Square Garden also hosts concerts and shows, such as Wintuk from Cirque de Soleil, and stand-up comedians like Chris Rock and Kathy Griffin.</li><li><strong><u>Barclays Centre:</u></strong> Major-league sports at the corner of Atlantic and Flatbush Avenues have been a long time coming-since the 1950s, in fact-but the 18,2000-seat Barclays Centre is now a reality. Home to the Brooklyn Nets, the arena also features the more intimate 7,700-seat Tidal theatre, the Shops at Barclays Centre (including the Nets Lifestyle Shop by Adidas), and more than 50 local food vendors. In addition to the Nets, the Barclays Centre hosts college and prep basketball, boxing, hockey, circuses, family shows, and concerts ranging from Arcade Fire to Jay Z to Yanni.</li><li><strong><u>Citi Field:</u></strong> The 42,000-seat venue echoes the design of Ebbets Field while also paying tribute to the baseball team’s Polo Grounds and Shea Stadium heritage, which dates back to 1962. The Mets Hall of Fame and Museum, next to Jackie Robinson Rotunda, celebrates the organisation’s history. From time to time, the stadium hosts major concerts-by the likes of Beyoncé and Foo Fighter-and other large non-baseball events.</li><li><strong><u>Flushing Meadows Corona Park:</u> </strong>The largest park in Queens (and fourth largest park in all of New York City) has something for jocks, artists, nature lovers and the technologically inclined: green recreational spaces for baseball, soccer and cricket; playgrounds; skateboarding areas; handball courts; dog runs; the Queen Museum; the New York Hall of Science; the Queens Zoo, USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Centre (home of the US Open); and Citi Field, home to the Mets. Also the Unispehere, a symbol of diversity constructed for the 1964-1965 World’s Fair, sit at the centre of Queen’s primary green space.</li><li><strong><u>Bronx Zoo:</u></strong> The Bronx Zoo of the Wildlife Conservation Society is the premier place to study and appreciate the world’s many creatures. Home to more than 6,000 animals, the zoo spans 265 acres that re-create the diverse natural habitats of its numerous residents. You’ll find the lemurs of Madagascar, gorillas of the Congo and snow leopards of the Himalayas, along with the denizens that stalk Tiger Mountain. Sea lion and penguin feedings are always visitors favourite.</li><li><strong><u>Brooklyn Bridge:</u></strong> the bridge was designed by John A. Roebling, an immigrant from Prussia, though he died due to complications from a freak accident in 1869, just before construction commenced. His son Washington took over supervision, but a case of the bends sidelined him. Washington Roebling’s wide, Emily, ultimately oversaw the balance of construction, which was completed in 1883; the bridge’s dedication and opening took place in 24<sup>th</sup> May 1883. The bridge has been celebrated in song, glamourized on celluloid and immortalized in poetry, the postcard-perfect Brooklyn Bridge stands as one of New York City’s most recognisable symbols – not to mention a magnificent feat of engineering. Upon its completion in 1883, it became the first roadway to connect Manhattan and Brooklyn. Back then, the Brooklyn Bridge was also the world’s longest suspension bridge – its 1595-foot central span unsurpassed until the Williamsburg Bridge’s completion two decades later. The bridge’s appearance sets it apart: its Gothic towers with double arches, criss-crossing steel cables and graceful, gentle curvature make walking or biking across the span a sough-after experience for visitors.</li><li><strong><u>The Staten Island Ferry:</u></strong> not only the way most New Yorkers and visitors travel between Manhattan and Staten Island, it is also an attraction unto itself. According to the Encyclopaedia of New York City, boat service between Staten Island and Manhattan dates back to 1731; it was a century later when steam-powered ferries began running the route. The City took over the ships in 1905, and they’ve remained an important part of the New York transit system, as well as a major tourist attraction since then. Before bridges linked NYC’s islands (Staten Island, Manhattan and Long Island – on which Brooklyn and Queens sit), boats were the way people travelled from one to another. Of the ferry services that still exist, the Staten Island Ferry serves by far the greatest number of passengers.</li><li><strong><u>The 9/11 Memorial &amp; Museum:</u></strong> designed by architect Michael Arad in collaboration with landscape architect Peter Walker. Arad, who witnessed the second plane hitting the World Trade Centre’s south tower, designed the 9/11 Memorial Museum to tells the story of the events of 9/11 through artefacts that range in scale from the monumental to the intimate, as well as through first-person accounts and multimedia displays. The 9/11 Memorial consists of two enormous reflecting pools set in the footprints of the Twin Towers. Each pool is about an acre in size, 30-foot waterfalls cascade down all sides. Hundreds of white oak trees line the surrounding plaza. Advance purchase of museum admission is strongly recommended. The 9/11 is open daily.</li><li><strong><u>Prospect Park:</u></strong> constructed between 1865 and 1895 by Central Park designers Frederick Law Olmsted and Calvert Vaux, Prospect Park is one of NY’s most beautiful and intriguing public spaces. With a size of 585-acre, the park is sandwiched between five Brooklyn neighbourhoods – Park Slope, Prospect Heights, Prospect Lefferts Gardens, Prospect Park South and Windsor Terrace. Prospect Park is known for its luxuriously vast green spaces, including wetlands, forest areas and a great number of trees. Some of its more popular attractions include the bandshell, Audubon Centre, the zoo and Grand Army Plaza, to name a few.</li><li><strong><u>Coney Island</u>:</strong> Coney Island – New York City’s legendary amusement district – is not a theme park. The home of the Cyclone roller coaster, the Wonder Wheel, the original Nathan’s Famous hot dogs and the Boardwalk is something different: a seaside playground that’s also a real-life NYC neighbourhood. Its many attractions have made it a warm-weather favourite for all, featuring see-it-to-believe-it sideshows, beachfront stands selling funnel cake, one of the City’s oldest and best pizzerias and the Brooklyn Cyclones baseball team. On a bright summer day, no place feels more electric.</li><li><strong><u>Lincoln Centre for the Performing Arts</u>:</strong> Lincoln Centre is one of the cornerstones of New York City’s culture, consisting of a campus of 11 organisations focused on music, dance and theatre. The David H. Koch Theatre, Metropolitan Opera House and David Geffen Hall provide stages for the New York City Ballet, Met Opera and New York Philharmonic – three of the 11 arts organisation in residence at Lincoln Centre.</li><li><strong><u>The High Line:</u></strong> one of the City’s most popular and distinctive parks. Built on a once-abandoned elevated rail line, the green space offers unparalleled views of Manhattan’s far west side. With places to sit and people-watch, patches of grass, seasonal blooms and fascinating architectural feature throughout, it’s a great place to relax, and makes for an envy-inducing photo backdrop.</li></ul><p style="font-size: 14px;"><strong>III. Gastronomy</strong></p><p style="font-size: 14px;"><strong>1. The must-taste of city:</strong></p><ul style="font-size: 14px;"><li><strong><u>Pizza</u> </strong>(signature for its big proportion): Joe’s Pizza, NY Pizza Surprema, Williamsburg Pizza, Best Pizza, Totonno’s Pizzeria Napolitano</li><li><strong><u>Bagel</u> </strong>(signatory boiled and baked to achieve a shiny finish and chewy consistency): Bagel Hole, Murray’s Bagels, Sadelle’s</li><li><strong><u>Cheesecake</u></strong> (NY cheesecake is known to be dense and creamy): Junior’s, S&amp;S Cheesecake, Eileen’s Special Cheesecake</li><li><strong><u>General Tso’s Chicken</u></strong> (delicious Chinese chicken dishes): Hunan House (classic), China Gourmet (cheap and cheerful), Shun Lee Palace (modern), Mission Chinese Food (well known for Old Fashioned cocktails)</li><li><strong><u>Egg Cream</u></strong>: Gem Spa, Yonah Schimmel Knish Bakery, Brooklyn Farmacy &amp; Soda Fountain</li><li><strong><u>Pastrami and Corned Beef</u>:</strong> Katz’s Delicatessen, Ben’s Best, David’s Brisket House, 2<sup>nd</sup> Ave Deli</li><li><strong><u>Street Meat</u>:</strong> Famous Halal Guys (chicken-lamb combo), Kwik Meal (lamb), Carnegie John’s (grilled chicken), Lil Zeus Lunch Box (pork souvlaki)</li><li><strong><u>Cronut</u></strong> (a flaky doughnut shell layered in the fashion of a croissant, with a creamy filling inside and icing on top): Dominique Ansel Bakery (most famous), Mille-Feuille, Dessert Club, Chikalicious, Paris Baguette</li></ul><p style="font-size: 14px;"><strong>2. The iconic local restaurants:</strong></p><ul style="font-size: 14px;"><li><strong>Bouley (163 Duane St, New York, NY 10013):</strong> Contemporary French cuisine</li><li><strong>Daniel Boulud (60 E. 65<sup>th</sup> St, New York, NY 10065):</strong> French contemporary cuisine</li><li><strong>Eleven Madison Park (11 Madison Ave., New York, NY 10010):</strong> one of the world’s finest dining experience</li><li><strong>Gabriel Kruther (41 W. 42<sup>nd</sup> St, New York, NY 10036):</strong> modern Western cuisine</li><li><strong>Jean-Georges (Trump International Hotel &amp; Tower New York – 1 Central Park W., New York, NY 10023):</strong> master chef inspired modern Western cuisine.</li><li><strong>Le Bernardin (The AXA Equitable Building – 155 W. 51<sup>st</sup> St, New York, NY 10019):</strong> specialized in seafood</li><li><strong>Masa (Time Warner Center – 10 Columbus Cir., New York, NY 10019):</strong> considered best Japanese restaurant in America.</li><li><strong>Nobu New York (105 Hudson St, New York, NY 10013):</strong> Robert de Niro’s restaurant chain, famous for the divine Japanese cuisine</li><li><strong>Per Se (Time Warner Center – 10 Columbus Cir. New York, NY 10019):</strong> French cuisine</li><li><strong>Sushi Nakazawa (23 Commerce St., New York, NY 10014):</strong> Japanese cuisine</li><li><strong>Brooklyn Dining:</strong><ul><li><strong>Peter Luger Steak House:</strong> operated since 1887, this legendary establishment draws meat lovers across the Williamsburg Bridge to a tucked-away, wood-panelled room where giant portions of top-notch meat are served alongside classic sides like onion rings and creamed spinach. Despite its location in one of New York’s trendiest Brooklyn neighbourhood, the Luger experience is staunchly old-fashioned (no credit cards) in the best sense of the phrase.</li><li><strong>Bamonte’s:</strong> Bamonte’s is Brooklyn’s oldest family owned and operated Italian restaurant, in business since 1990. They specialised in Nepolitan cooking and offer their customers an ambiance of Old World charm and service. Their specialty dishes include linguine with crab sauce, seafood fra diavolo, pork chop with vinegar peppers, mussels marinara and homemade pasta, as well as other seasonal dishes.</li><li><strong>L&amp;B Spumoni Gardens:</strong> In the land of floppy triangles, the square-shaped pizza is king. L&amp;B Spumoni Gardens is one of those great historic pizzerias peculiar to Brooklyn, but L&amp;B serves a uniquely satisfying Sicilian slice: thick slabs of crust, with a layer of mozzarella below a hefty serving of tomato sauce and olive oil with a sprinkling of Pecorino Romano cheese.</li><li><strong>Iris Café:</strong> It’s not always easy to get a seat in this small, bohemian café-it’s lovable, so everybody comes here, even from Manhattan-plus, people on laptops understandably don’t want to relinquish their perfect, sunny perches. A hipster crew dispenses great breakfast (house-made granola, sticky buns, eggs with cheddar cheese grits), lunch (sandwiches with arresting combinations, sweet and spicy beef jerky) and excellent Stumptown coffee. You can also make a grocery run here for fresh milk, free-range eggs and other assorted staples.</li><li><strong>Butter &amp; Scotch:</strong> a honky-tonk with a difference, specialising in desserts and cocktails. Strains of funk and gospel accompany visits here, and a neon sign declaring “Eat Pie” hangs over the swinging doors that lead to the kitchen. Partners Keavy Blueher and Allision Kave funded their merry venture through a Kickstarter campaign, allowing them to buy professional baker’s ovens and a liquor license. The rollicking corner space is convenient to the Brooklyn Botanic Garden and the Franklin Avenue subway top. At happy hours, certain drinks and desserts are discounted, but it’s a happy scene here pretty much all the time. In addition to frosted layer cakes, fresh made caramel corn and mini cupcakes, this sweet spot offers savoury items like pimento cheese with Triscuits, cheesy puffs and salty sesame-chile popcorn.</li><li><strong>Buttermilk Channel:</strong> an American bistro best known for its duck meatloaf and buttermilk fried chicken with cheddar waffles. The seasonal menu has its lighter side as well with whole grilled fish, local oysters and plenty of vegetarian options. Signature and classic cocktails are skilfully prepared and the wine list is focused on small, traditional French and American wineries. The restaurant is named for the tidal straight between Brooklyn and Governors Island, said to be so strong it could churn milk into butter.</li><li><strong>Maison Premier:</strong> this oyster house with a spirited atmosphere, bivalves and absinthe in copious quantities is a one famous restaurant in town. The interior of Maison Premier is nothing short of lovely; a modern homage to Parisian and New Orleans oyster bars of yesteryear. The emphasis here is on old-world elegance, from the grand marble horseshoe bar at the heart of the space to the carefully considered details throughout. There is also a worth-noting menu, which boasts 30 different oyster varieties, top-notch cocktails and the “largest premium absinthe collection in New York City”. Happy hour, from 4-7pm on weekdays and 11am-1pm on weekends, is particularly busy, thanks to oysters priced at just $1 each.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Queens Dining:</strong><ul><li><strong>Casa Enrique:</strong> for its impressive posole, mole and chile relleno, Casa Enrique captured a star in Michelin’s 2015 guide. The Long Island City restaurant was singled out for its “haute take on Mexican cuisine” that’s a “welcome blend of creativity and tradition. The “haute” part comes courtesy of Cosme Aguilar, a French-trained chef from Mexico’s southernmost state of Chiapas. He and his brother Luis opened this sleed, contemporary hot spot in 2012 and got noticed almost immediately for superior tacos cradling slowly cooked brisket and complex, labor-intensive mole sauce saturating tender chicken breast. Kick things off with some fine tequila and chunky, jalapeno-laced guacamole, and finish with luscious, caramel-topped tres leche cake.</li><li><strong>Danny Brown Wine Bar &amp; Kitchen:</strong> For four years, Forest Hill’s Danny Brown Wine Bar &amp; Kitchen was the only Queens restaurant with a Michelin star. In 2015, the standby took home the honour for a fifth straight year, this time joined by three other borough eateries. The intimate, convivial enoteca isappointed with modern art and has a stylish European vibe. Chef and co-owner Danny Brown trained in kitchens in Spain, France and Italy, and there’s an element of each nation’s cuisine in his own. Balanced, perfectly executed dishes include Serrano ham croquettes, bacon-wrapped terrine of rabbit with red-wine-poached prunes, and mighty sweet pea ravioli with black olive crumble and light ricotta. Wines on the list span the globe.</li><li><strong>Dumpling Galaxy:</strong> Flushing is bursting with great Asian spots, and the one everyone’s heading to these days is Dumpling Galaxy. Inside the Arcadia Mall, a few blocks from the last stop on the 7 train in Queens, is a modern, red-accented restaurant featuring a veritable star system of dumplings. Lamb and chives, duck and shiitakes, beed and carrots, asparagus and egg- these only begin the tell the story. Steamed or panfried, they’re overstuffed, artful sealed and very tasty. Other specialties over the years include scallion pancakes, steamed whole fish and sweet and sour pork.</li><li><strong>Mapo Korean B.B.Q:</strong> Queen’s Murray Hill, whose name comes from the same family as the Murray Hill in Manhattan, hosts a thriving Korean population and feels like a village on the outskirts of Seoul. Mapo Korean B.B.Q is among the neighbourhood’s best steakhouses, although it’s so unadorned it looks more like a barbecue joint. Prime meats are marinated and cooked over charcoals embedded in the centre of each table, the duty handled by assiduous waitresses who control the flames and flip and snip bites small enough to be wrapped in lettuce leaves. Kalbi-beef shirt ribs-are the most essential dish here, and their price includes a whirlwind of accompaniments like tofu soup, spicy kimchi, marinated vegetables, creamed corn, smashed potatoes, potato salad and steamed, custard-like eggs.</li><li><strong>Salt &amp; Fat:</strong> the tasty of two components liberally applied, in various guises (frequently bacon or ham, sometimes spicy mayo or a duck fat crouton), to the like of grilled asparagus, Prince Edward Island mussels’ broth, arctic char and the occasional dessert are all served in thie Sunnyside restaurant in Queens. Chef and owner Daniel Yi frequently alters his globally influenced New American menu and keeps portions small, tapas style, so course are rich but not heavy. Three to four dishes are enough for two to share. The comfortable, candlelit space offers attentive service, compliment bacon-fat popcorn to start and free yoghurt drinks at the end.</li><li><strong>Taverna Kyclades:</strong> Astoria has grown more multicultural in recent years but retains a strong Greek contingent. It also continues to attracts multitudes of Greek food lovers, judging from the lines out the door at Taverna Kyclades. Even on weekdays, people wait for sidewalk tables-especially when it’s sunny. The boisterous, Mediterranean-themed dining room is appointed with a trophy swordfish, signifying that seafood is a strong point. Charred, meaty octopus, lightly battered calamari and whole sea bass all taste freshly caught. Pan-fried cheese, giant salads and assorted dips of skordalia, tzatziki and taramosalata spread on pita are also wonderful. The staff adds to the good cheer by handing out complimentary wine id the wait is long-and carafes are such a good deal there’s no reason to not keep it flowing.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Bronx Dining:</strong><ul><li>South Bronx = Soul Food</li><li>Arthur Avenue = Italian Provisions</li><li>City Island = Fresh Seafood</li><li>The rest of Bronx = Cuisine of the World.</li></ul></li></ul><p style="font-size: 14px;"><strong>IV.

Introduction</strong></p><p style="font-size: 14px;">Las Vegas, often known as Vegas, is a city in the United States, the most populous city in the state of Nevada, the county seat of Clark County, and the city proper of the Las Vegas Valley. “What happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas!”. Las Vegas called itself The Entertainment Capital of the World as it’s famous for all the mega casino hotels, major resorts, extremely colourful nightlife and associated entertainment.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;">The city is one of the top three leading destinations in the United States for conventions, business, and meetings. In addition, the city’s metropolitan area has more AAA Five Diamond hotels than any other city in the world, and is a global leader in the hospitality industry. It’s an understatement to say that today, Las Vegas is one of the top tourist destinations in the world.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;"><strong>2. History of Foundation</strong></p><p style="font-size: 14px;">The name Las Vegas comes from Spanish for “the meadows”. The land was originally the home to the Navajo and other nomadic American Indians. In 1829, a Mexican trader by the name of Antonio Armijo came across what he called a grassland meadow, hence the name Las Vegas for that area. In 1855, the Mormons sent a small group of settlers to help the local Indians plant crops and set up a safe way station between Los Angeles and Salt Lake City, but by 1857, the safe way station was abandoned.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;">In 1905, the city of Las Vegas was established. In 1931, two things happened that would forever change Las Vegas and help to shape the city’s future’s path. The first thing was the construction on the Hoover Dam began, and thousands of workers were brought in to the city. At the same time, casino gambling was legalised. For years, the city struggled as a small town until Bugsy Siegel, the infamous New York mobster, opened his Flamingo Hotel in 1946.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;">Following World War II, lavishly decorated hotels, gambling casinos and big-name entertainment became synonymous with Las Vegas. The 1950s saw the opening of the Moulin Rouge, the first racially integrated casino-hotel in Las Vegas. During the 1960s, corporations and business powerhouses such as Howard Hughes were building and buying hotel-casino properties. Gambling was referred to as “gaming”, which transitioned into legitimate business. In 1989, entrepreneur Steve Wynn changed the face of the Las Vegas gaming industry by opening up The Mirage, the Las Vegas’s first mega-casino resort. The year 1995 marked the opening of the Fremont Street Experience in Las Vegas’s downtown area. This canopied, five-block area features 12.5 million LED lights and 550,000 watts of sound from dusk until midnight shows help on the top of each hour, turned Vegas into a city that truly never sleeps.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;"><strong>3. Area &amp; Population</strong></p><p style="font-size: 14px;">Las Vegas is situated within Clark County in a basin on the floor of the Mojave Desert, and is surrounded by mountain ranges of all sides. Much of the landscape is rocky and arid with desert vegetation and wildlife. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 135.86 square miles (351.9 km²), of which 99.7% is land with a very small area covered with water. Within the city, there are many lawns, trees and other greenery. Due to water resource issues, there has been a movement to encourage conservation programs aiming to reserve water and landscape.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;">Las Vegas has a population of approximately 603,500 people, with White takes up 47.9% of the population. Black or African American is 11.1% of the population, while Hispanic or Latino is 31.5%, Asian only 6.1%. The city’s most populous group, non-Hispanic Whites, have proportionally declined from 87.6% in 1970 while Hispanic or Latino increased from 4.6% to 31.5% from 1970.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;">According to a 2004 study, Las Vegas has one of the highest divorce rates, not wholly due to the Las Vegas themselves getting divorced but more because divorce is easier in Nevada than most other states – many people therefore go there for easier process. Similarly, Nevada marriages a notoriously easy to get. Las Vegas has one of the highest marriage rates of U.S cities, with many licenses issued to people from outside the area.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;"><strong>4. Fun Facts &amp; Figures</strong></p><ul style="font-size: 14px;"><li>Most of Vegas’s iconic hotels aren’t technically located in the city of Las Vegas. A good portion of the Las Vegas Strip – and the famed “Welcome to Fabulous Las Vegas” sign – are actually located in an unincorporated township called Paradise, Nevada.</li><li>The strip’s Flamingo Las Vegas Hotel and Casino got its name from founder – and legendary mobster – Bugsy Siegel’s girlfriend. Actress Virginia Hill went by the nickname “The Flamingo” because of her red hair and long, thin legs.</li><li>Vegas Vic – the oversized neon cowboy that presides over downtown’s famed Fremont Street – it’s the largest mechanical neon sign in the world.</li><li>More than 41 million visitors cycle through Sin City each year, which might explain why the town boasts 14 of the world’s 20 biggest hotels.</li><li>There’s a secret city underneath the city. Miles of tunnels – originally built to protect the desert town from flash floods.</li><li>In May 1955, the Moulin Rouge made history when it became the city’s first interracial casino. Legendary boxer Joe Louis, a part owner, declared “This isn’t the opening of a Las Vegas hotel. It’s history.”</li><li>It takes roughly 10 minutes to nab a marriage license at the bureau in downtown Las Vegas, which is open every day from 8am until midnight. No wonder some 10,000 couples wed in the city each month.</li><li>The half-scale model of the Eiffel Tower, located outside Paris Las Vegas, was originally planned to be full-size, but due to the close proximity of the airport- just three miles – it had to be shrunk down. In contrast, the Luxor Las Vegas’s Sphinx is actually larger than the original Great Sphinx of Giza.</li><li>At 50 tons, the bronze lion outside the MGM Grand Hotel is believed to be the largest bronze sculpture in the western hemisphere.</li><li>The distinctive gold colour of the windows at the Mirage Hotel comes from actual gold dust.</li><li>Before his death in 2009, Michael Jackson was looking into doing a Vegas residency. He planned to advertise it with a 50-foot robot-likeness of himself that would roam the Nevada desert.</li><li>From outer space, the Las Vegas Strip appears as the brightest spot on Earth.</li></ul><p style="font-size: 14px;"><strong>5.

The exhibit concluded with a memorial wall honouring all those who lost their lives on the infamous ship.</li><li><strong>Hand of Faith – Golden Nugget</strong>: In the spring of 1980, Kevin Hillier took his new metal detector out for a spin in his tiny hometown of Wedderburn, Australia. Instead of a bottle cap or a paper clip, he found a 61-pound golden nugget barely a foot underground. The Hand of Faith is the biggest golden nugget in existence, the second-biggest ever discovered, and the biggest ever found with a metal detector. (Hillier sold his golden nugget to the Golden Nugget for over a million dollars).</li><li><strong>Bellagio Conservatory &amp; Botanical Garden</strong>: Each season, the enormously talented horticulturalists and designers who make up the Bellagio Conservatory team transform this 14,000-dquare-foot floral playground into a showcase of the distinctive sights and colours of spring, summer, fall, and winter-along with a special display for Lunar New Year.

Ft. showroom with over 250 World Class automobiles on display and available for sale.

Must-eat in Las Vegas</strong></p><ul style="font-size: 14px;"><li><strong>The riserva steak</strong>: Dry-aging is rightfully all the rage, but 60 days is for wusses. Carnevino does it the right way with the riserva—minimum <em>240-day</em> dry-aged steaks. The riserva displays the pungency of gorgonzola while conveying the essence of pure meat in every bite. After experiencing this, you’ll never look at steak in the same way. (<em><u>Carnevino, at Palazzo, 789-4141</u></em><em>.)</em></li><li><strong>Chicken fingers:</strong> Crispy, golden breading wraps impossibly moist chicken with wide bowls of hot sauce and ranch for dipping. (<em><u>Crown &amp; Anchor British Pub, 1350 E. Tropicana Ave., 739-8676; 4755 Spring Mountain Road, 876-4733</u></em><em>.</em><em>)</em></li><li><strong>Hot N Juicy style shrimp</strong>: go with the shrimp Hot N Juicy style in a seasoning mix that combines all the other flavors for a garlicky, Cajun kick that will have you licking your fingers long after the last crustacean has disappeared into your belly. (<em><u>Hot N Juicy Crawfish, 4810 Spring Mountain Road, Suite C-D, 891-8889; 3863 Spring Mountain Road, 750-2428.</u></em><em><u>)</u></em></li><li><em><strong>Consome loco and cochinita pibil tacos:</strong></em> <em>this authentic Mexican food, which is a </em>crazy-good chicken soup with rice, avocado and lime that’s as comforting as anything your mother makes. Follow it with a pair of <em>cochinita pibil</em> tacos, spicy pork cooked in banana leaves and topped with pickled onions. (<em><u>Los Antojos, 2520 S. Eastern Ave., #B, 457-3505</u></em><em>.</em><em>)</em></li><li><em><strong>Khao soi</strong></em><em>: </em>Coconut cream curry packs a sweet, mellow heat over egg noodles and your protein of choice, garnished with red onion, lime and pickled vegetables for some essential balance. (<em><u>Lotus of Siam, 953 E. Sahara Avenue #A5, 735-3033.</u></em><em><u>)</u></em></li><li><em><strong>Honey toast</strong></em><em>: </em>a loaf of chewy white bread with the top lopped off, baked till the crust is crisp with butter and honey melted into its gooey center then topped with heavy scoops of vanilla ice cream. It’s hot and cold, salty and sweet—the kind of simple, gratifying dessert that lingers long after you’ve put down the spoon. (<em><u>Ichiza, 4355 Spring Mountain Road, 367-3151</u></em><em>.</em><em>)</em></li><li><em><strong>Chicken fried lobster</strong></em><em>: </em>a large piece of lobster tail, breaded and fried, can hold its own with any steak or prime rib in the place. Along with a baked potato and the rest of the fixins, you’ll be lucky if you can finish the whole meal. (<em><u>Binion’s Ranch Steak House, at Binion’s, 382-1600</u></em><em>.</em><em>)</em></li></ul><p style="font-size: 14px;"><strong>2. Iconic Restaurants:</strong></p><ul style="font-size: 14px;"><li><em><strong>Michael’s Gourmet Room:</strong></em> The best kept fine dining secret in Las Vegas, Michael’s is super old school, with tuxedoed waiters and captains doing tableside presentations like deboning Dover Sole and igniting bananas Foster flambé, while serving up hard to find forgotten classics like veal saltimbocca and Coquille St. Jacques – even the signature sorbet intermezzo is topped with Dom Perignon. Michael’s has been doing its thing since 1979, and was the anchor for the late Barbary Coast Casino. It was relocated along with its most famous fixtures, an enormous entry door, the Tiffany glass domed ceiling, and its career waiters, to the South Point Resort, a large casino hotel catering mainly to locals and equestrians a few miles south of Mandalay Bay on Las Vegas Boulevard. It seats just 50 in plush banquets, dinner only, and to step in is to renter the city’s Golden Age – it is absolutely worth the trip, though very expensive.</li><li><strong>Sterling Brunch</strong>: always voted the city’s best. it is one of the few “champagne” brunches in the country actually serving real champagne, Perrier-Jouet, unlimited and poured generously by excellent wait staff, along with bottomless mimosas and Bloody Mary’s. The food signatures are whole lobster tails with drawn butter, the caviar station, and the raw bar with fresh shucked oysters. There is a lot more too, from Stone crab claws to rack of lamb, dim sum station, sushi station, hand carved meats and made to order desserts including crepes, all in an elegant setting. Anything that takes time, like eggs or desserts cooked to order, is delivered to your table, a really nice touch. Lots of brunch buffets boast omelette stations but how many serve up a house specialty omelette of lobster, cognac and boursin cheese?</li><li><em><strong>Du-par’s</strong></em><em>: </em>Most locals actually flock to this 24-hour coffee shop in the Golden Gate hotel downtown for its famously beloved pancakes, perennially rated the best in town, along with a vast slate of homemade pies. In true diner style, it has a huge menu, from breakfast to blue plate lunches to all sorts of dinner entrees, and a bakery list that goes on and on, but its classic status comes from one singular item, the shrimp cocktail. The Golden Gate was Las Vegas’ very first hotel (different name in 1906), and was assigned the first telephone number in Las Vegas (simply 1), sits at One Fremont Street, and among its many historic firsts was the 50-cent shrimp cocktail, launched in 1961 as part of a San Francisco/Fisherman’s Wharf rebranding theme.</li><li><strong>The Golden Steer</strong>: has been the place for beef since 1958, serving big steaks with classic steakhouse starters and sides like jumbo shrimp cocktail, crab cakes and hash browns, the place has a decidedly local, neighbourhood tavern feel, especially in its incongruously downscale bar room, complete with video poker. The Golden Steer is a high-end steakhouse, and not cheap, but noticeably less expensive than its Strip hotel and celebrity chef competitors.</li><li><strong>Hugo’s Cellar</strong>: sits in the bottom of the otherwise easy to overlook Four Queens casino in old Downtown. Its signature is a huge salad cart wheeled to the table where your salad is theatrically assembled to order. It has a more traditionally Continental style than the steak-centric Top of Binion’s Steakhouse, another classic just down the street, with forgotten dishes like duck flambé and seafood en papillote. There’s a cozy cocktail lounge where they serve pate and crackers, nothing has changed here in forever, and locals pack the place, especially on weekends.</li><li><strong>Top of Binion’s Steakhouse:</strong> It is home to another old school classic steakhouse, predating the moon landing (and relocated within Binion’s in 1994), on the top floor, reached by private elevator and boasting great views of Fremont Street. The menu is simple, with sides like iceberg wedge salad and creamed spinach anchoring a list of 28-day dry aged, grass-fed, corn-finished steaks, but there is a notable exception that puts the place on the map – the legendary one of a kind signature dish, Chicken Fried Lobster. Developed as a special dish for country music star Merle Haggard, it gained a cult reputation among cowboys visiting for the Rodeo world championships, and is now a staple. A large whole lobster tail is shelled, flattened, dredged in milk and flour, and then of course deep fried.</li><li><strong>Peppermill</strong>: it is one of very few old freestanding restaurants on the Strip, not associated with any casino, and its past clientele is a Vegas Who’s Who that includes Frank Sinatra and Jerry Lewis. It is within Vegas icons, where regulars and tourists flock side by side. This true classic has so much frozen in time atmosphere it has been used in many movies and television shows, from <em>Casino</em> to <em>CSI</em><em>.</em></li><li><strong>Chicago Joe’s:</strong> serving big portions of its hearty fare to deeply loyal local fans at very reasonable prices. Think linguine with clam sauce, spaghetti and meatballs, and eggplant, shrimp or chicken parmesan, all accompanied by rolls and a simple house salad with creamy Caesar.</li></ul><p style="font-size: 14px;"><em><strong>IV.

45	en	<p style="font-size: 14px;"><strong>I. General Information</strong></p><p style="font-size: 14px;"><strong>1. Introduction</strong></p><p style="font-size: 14px;">A little more than a century ago, a city sprung up almost overnight. As a result, one of Miami’s many nicknames is the Magic City. Much like its geographical description, Miami is surging as a major international port and a gateway for global industries establishing footholds in the U.S.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;">With great year-round weather, top-ranked beaches and the sparkling waters of Biscayne Bay as the backdrops for a cosmopolitan metropolis and pulsing rhythms of diversity, Miami is definitely sitting on top of the bucket’s lists of destination to visit.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;"><strong>2. History of Foundation</strong></p><p style="font-size: 14px;">The Miami area was inhabited for thousands of years by Indigenous cultures. The Tequestas had been there with their village of hundreds of people dating back to 500-600 B.C at the mouth of the Miami River. Later, Juan Ponce de Leon was the first European to visit in 1513 and Spain is credited for the first recorded landing in 1566. Shortly after the Spanish rule established a mission on the river’s north bank, the Tequestas were targeted for conversion to Christianity. The attempt failed and a majority of the tribe, disease-stricken with small pox and other illnesses died.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;">The attack of the United States land expansion to displace and relocate American Indians brought large migrations of Native Americans around the late 1700’s to South Florida. After Florida was ceded to the United States and purchased from Spain in 1819, three major wars were waged by the Seminoles against the U.S. Government. The Miami area was devastated by the second ward and was known as one of the worst events in American history. These wars attributed for the slow settlement of Miami until 1842.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;">Then, William English charted the “Village of Miami” and the village was established on the south bank of the Miami River. One the north side of the river, Julia Tuttle, a wealthy widow from Ohio, purchased a large citrus plantation in addition to a plot she inherited. She had envisioned the City as a gateway for international trade. By April 1896, the railroad tracks reached Miami and in July a meeting was held to incorporate the city. The right to vote was restricted to men and a third of the voters were Bahamian immigrants. The City was incorporated in 1896 with 444 citizens under the name of “The City of Miami”.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;">Along with the railroad, Flagler financed and built streets, water and power systems and a resort hotel. Canals were made to drain water from the everglades that covered a majority of the land. It was no surprise that Miami soon became an instant tourist attraction and retreat for the rich and famous. This prompted the first of many real estate booms.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;">In 1959, the Cuban dictator Fidel Castro came to power. What followed was a mass exodus of people from Cuba to Miami. Hundreds of thousands of Cubans came to Miami thinking it to be a temporary home until their home was freed from its communistic reign. An invasion of Cuba was planned by the U.S., which became known as “The Bay of Pigs”, but was disrupted when the Soviet Union threatened the U.S. with warfare. Since the late 1960’s, Miami has become a mix of cultural influences – with mainly Cubans, African-American, and Caribbean.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;"><strong>3. Area &amp; Population</strong></p><p style="font-size: 14px;">The City of Miami is located in Southeast Florida in Miami-Dade County on the Miami River, between the Florida Everglades and the Atlantic Ocean. The main portion of the city lies on the shores of Biscayne Bay which contains several hundred natural and artificially created barrier islands, the largest of which contains Miami Beach and South Beach. The Gulf Stream, a warm ocean current, runs northward just 15 miles (24 km) off the coast, allowing the city’s climate to stay warm all year.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;">Miami is partitioned into North, South, West, and Downtown sections. The heart of the city is Downtown Miami and is technically on the eastern side of the city.  Downtown is home to many major banks, courthouses, financial headquarters, cultural and tourist attractions, schools, parks, hospital and medical research centres, and a large residential population. The southern side of Miami includes Coral Way, The Roads and Coconut Grove. The south is where a lot of nightclubs, bars, restaurants and bohemian shops are located. Therefore, it is very popular with local college students. The western side of Miami includes Little Havana, West Flagler, and Flagami, and is home to many of the city’s traditionally immigrant neighbourhoods. The northern side of Miami includes Midtown, a district that has a great mix of diversity with West Indians, Hispanics, European Americans, bohemians, and artists. The wealthier residents usually live in the north-eastern part, in Midtown, the Design District, and the Upper East Side.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;">The Miami metropolitan area has a population of more than 5.5 million people, ranked seventh largest in the United States, and is the largest metropolitan area in the South-eastern United States. As of 2010, 69.96% of the population are Hispanic that mainly of Cuban origin, 16% are African-American, 11.92% are White, and 1.85% are of Asian ancestry.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;"><strong>4.

Gastronomy</strong></p><p style="font-size: 14px;"><strong>1. Must-eat in Miami</strong></p><ul style="font-size: 14px;"><li><strong>Arepas:</strong> think a flattened, pancake like grilled cheese and add some Colombian and Venezuelan flare. Arepas are made with a maize-like dough, stuffed with cheese, most commonly, and cooked until the dough reaches a golden brown. (at <em><u>La Latina Miami - 3509 NE 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33137</u></em>)</li><li><strong>Biskits</strong>: a honey, apple cider glaze and a dash of Maldon. (at <em><u>The Fed - 5132 Biscayne Blvd, FL 33137</u></em>)</li><li><strong>Café con Leche y Tostada Cubana</strong>: Nothing gets more simple, or classic, than cafe con leche and grilled bread. Similar to a cafe latte, the brew is instead made with Cuban coffee, an intense dose of espresso with what will seem like equal parts sugar. The buttered, Cuban bread can then be eaten alongside or dunked in the coffee to for a sweet and creamy pick-me up. (at <em><u>David’s Café - 8718 SW 40th St, Miami, FL 33165</u></em>)</li><li><strong>Ceviche</strong>: One of the most versatile dishes, ceviche consists of three parts: fish, acid, spice. Anything else is strictly embellishment. This Peruvian dish has been transformed into an American staple and is a must have for every menu card along a coastline. It's as classic Miami as white linen pants. (at <em><u>My Ceviche Brickell - 1250 S Miami Ave, Miami, FL 33130</u></em>)</li><li><strong>Croquetas</strong>: Ham, cheese, chorizo, and chicken can all be found stuffed within Miami's best croquetas. Technically anything that is a minced or smashed into a small disk or cylinder then breaded and fried is a croqueta. Surprisingly enough, this includes crab cakes and mozzarella sticks. In Miami, you can find them in restaurants and bakeries just as often as you can along boardwalks.</li><li><strong>Cuban Mojo</strong>: In Miami, Cuban mojo is on piled on everything. Most commonly made with garlic, sour orange juice, and occasionally olive oil, the sauce can act as a marinade for barbecuing or even a condiment in sandwiches that adds a zesty, garlic kick.</li><li><strong>Cuban Sandwich</strong>: Miami’s most iconic dish. A true collaboration between Cuban migrant workers and Floridians in the late 1800s and the early 20th century, this spin on the old ham and cheese is most often found simply with fresh Cuban bread, yellow mustard, roasted pork, baked ham, Swiss cheese, and sliced dill pickles. (at <em><u>Versailles Restaurant - 3555 SW 8th St, Miami, FL 33135</u></em>)</li><li><strong>Deviled Eggs</strong>: a perfect snack menu item that takes a boring hard-boiled egg up several notches and transforms it into a delicious and delicate dish. The precisely cooked egg yolk is removed from the egg white and classically mixed with mayonnaise, Dijon mustard, lemon juice, and a touch of hot sauce. Once the mixture is complete, it is pipetted back into the egg white ‘casing,’ ready to be served. (at <em><u>Michael’s Genuine Food &amp; Drink - 130 NE 40th St, Miami, FL 33137</u></em>)</li><li><strong>Fritas</strong>: a Cuban take on burger that has national appeal. A little spiced, ground beef, a little mojo, a few onions, and some shoestring potatoes, you have a frita. If it's a good enough grab for Obama while visiting the Magic City, then it's a good enough grab for you. (<em><u>at El Mago de las Fritas - 5828 SW 8th St, West Miami, FL 33144</u></em>)</li><li><strong>Mofongo</strong>: a Puerto Rican speciality that is as beloved in Miami as it is in its hometown, featuring a small mountain made of fried plantains, garlic, and chicharrones that have all been smashed and molded together in a wooden mortar and pestle known as a pilon. Different variations can be made by adding seafood, chicken, pork, or broth.</li><li><strong>Stone Crab Claws</strong>: Served cracked and chilled on ice, Florida Stone Crab claws can vary in size between 2.75 inches length to over a colossal 2 pounds. The sweet, lobster-esque meat needs little seasoning, yet is still classically served with hash browns, cole slaw, lemon, and mayo, butter, or tartar sauce. (at <em><u>Joe’s Stone Crab - 11 Washington Ave, Miami Beach, FL 33139</u></em>)</li></ul><p style="font-size: 14px;"><strong>2.

48	en	<p><strong style="font-size: 14px;">I. General Information</strong><br/></p><p style="font-size: 14px;"><strong>1. Introduction</strong></p><p style="font-size: 14px;">This central Florida city has everything to offer those who are looking to experience the most remarkable moments of their lives including great shopping malls, amazing rides at Disneyland, great food and white-knuckle skydiving encounters. The city boasts over 5,000 restaurants from fine dining experiences to family-friendly favourites, about 170 spectacular golf courses where both novice and expert golfers can take on a wide range of challenging courses, and great shopping centres where you can buy an array of top quality items including jewellery, bags, clothes and much more. The city also plays home to incredible resort style spas where guests are treated to heavenly relaxation. Orlando is most definitely among the world’s premier destinations with an array of fun and exciting things to do that keeps most visitors coming back to experience more fun.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;"><strong>2. History of Foundation</strong></p><p style="font-size: 14px;">Prior to the arrival of the first European settlers in 1837, the area that is now Orlando was occupied by the Seminole tribe of Native Americans. Historians believe that the Seminoles, whose named is said to mean &#34;wild and separate,&#34; inhabited the Central Florida region for 6,000 to 12,000 years. The Second Seminole War, which spanned the period from 1835 to 1842, began when disagreements arose between the natives and the American settlers on such issues as land, cattle, and slaves. In the years following the war the natives moved away, leaving the pioneers who built their town around Fort Gatlin. Until 1845 Orange County, of which the city of Orlando is the county seat, was known as Mosquito County. Tradition holds that Orlando was named after Orlando Reeves, an American soldier on sentinel duty for a scouting party. While Reeves' companion slept, a native approached disguised as a rolling log. Reeves, seeing what was occurring, fired his gun, woke the other soldiers, and saved them from peril. However, Reeves himself succumbed to an arrow shot by the native. Prior to receiving the name Orlando in 1857, the town was known as Jernigan, after Aaron Jernigan, a settler from Georgia.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;">During the 1880s, some of the pioneers started growing citrus trees. The growth of Orlando in size and prosperity was associated with the need for better transportation to citrus markets on the part of citrus growers. The city had its first rail lines by 1881. During the 1880s and 1890s, there was an influx of new fruit growers. In 1885, Rollins College was founded in Winter Park. By 1886, the city’s streets were lined with office buildings, churches, hotels, and schools, and tourists from the north began to spend summers in the area.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;">Disaster struck in 1894 when a three-day freeze destroyed nearly all the citrus trees in Orange County. The freeze had a devastating effect on the community, which suffered losses of an estimated $100 million. Packing plants closed, bank closed, people lost their job, and it was 15 years before Orlando fully recovered.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;">Between 1910 and 1920 the population of Orlando doubled, and the city was transformed from a rural citrus growing area to a major city. During the 1920s a great building boom aided in Orlando's continuing prosperity, evidenced by the opening of the Orlando Public Library in 1923 and the Municipal Auditorium (now Bob Carr Auditorium) in 1926. During the Great Depression of the 1930s, the federal government's Works Progress Administration programs aided in the upgrading of the Municipal Airport, the building of a new football stadium at Tinker Field, and park development, and by 1944 many new jobs had been created. Another building boom followed World War II, and new suburbs, new roadways, and new shopping centres were built.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;">The development of Walt Disney World in 1971 spurred a construction boom that included apartment buildings, hotels and motels, banks, commercial shopping areas, and tourist-related businesses. The city's Municipal Justice Building was erected in 1972 and Sea World of Florida followed in 1973. Tourism increased, thanks to tourist sites such as Epcot Center built in 1982, and the Disney-MGM Studios theme park, which opened in 1989. To the dismay of many local people, what had once been a sleepy backwater town was rapidly becoming a world class tourist mecca. The town of Orlando was recognized as one of the world's most popular vacation sites.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;"><strong>3.

Weather</strong></p><p style="font-size: 14px;">Orlando has a humid subtropical climate and transitional climate similar to Tampa. There are two major seasons each year. One is hot and rainy, lasting from May until late September (roughly coinciding with the Atlantic hurricane season). The other is the dry, relatively mild season (late October through April) bringing less frequent rainfall, yet still with warm temperatures.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;">During the height of Orlando's humid summer season, high temperatures are typically in the lower to mid-90s °F (32–36 °C), while low temperatures rarely fall below 70 °F (21 °C). During September, strong afternoon thunderstorms occur almost daily. These storms are caused by air masses from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_of_Mexico">Gulf of Mexico</a> and the Atlantic Ocean colliding over Central Florida. They are highlighted by spectacular <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightning">lightning</a> and can also bring heavy rain (sometimes several inches per hour) and powerful winds as well as occasional damaging <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hail">hail</a>.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;">During the cooler seasons, humidity is lower and temperatures are more moderate, and can fluctuate more readily. The monthly daily average temperature in January is 60.2 °F (15.7 °C).  Because the winter season is dry and freezing temperatures usually occur only after cold fronts (and their accompanying precipitation) have passed, snow is exceptionally rare.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;"><strong>6.

Guests can see the artificial Caribbean coral reef at The Seas with Nemo &amp; Friends at Epcot. Living coral reefs are diverse ecosystems built by large colonies of tiny animals called coral polyps. Coral reefs not only support a vast array of marine organisms, but also help provide natural protective barriers that guard against coastal erosion. However, these stony natural wonders are undergoing numerous threats, including bleaching, disease and invasive predators. Reduced growth and death of coral reefs are often the result of coastal development, changing climate, and acidification of the ocean’s delicate chemistry. In an effort to reverse the decline of shrinking Bahamian reefs, Disney is collaborating with experts in the Caribbean and investing in comprehensive study and training, as well as taking action to create coral nurseries, limit harmful human contact around existing reefs and promote reef rehabilitation and ecosystem resilience.</li></ul><ul style="font-size: 14px;"><li><strong><em><u>Dumbo the Flying Elephant</u></em>:</strong> Hop atop Dumbo and take off into the air on a joyful journey amid the jubilant sounds of carnival music.

Introduction</strong></p><p style="font-size: 14px;">Located on the island of Oahu’s south sore, Honolulu is the vibrant epicenter of Hawaii. This capital and largest city of Hawaii is where you’ll find everything from historic landmarks, treasured monuments to flourishing arts, and cultural scene. Moreover, from the nightlife, live music and fine dining of Waikiki to the art galleries and underground bars, to Hawaii’s finest museums or finest Hawaii Regional Cuisine chef, the best resorts, festivals, and events; being in Honolulu is no doubt a guarantee to one of the best holidays you’ll experience.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;"><strong>2. History of Foundation</strong></p><p style="font-size: 14px;">The name Honolulu means “sheltered bay” or “peace of shelter” in Hawaiian, and its natural harbor catapulted this humble village to importance in 1809, shortly after King Kamehameta I conquered Oahu in order to unite the Hawaiian Islands under the Kingdom of Hawaii, that he moved his royal court form the island of Hawaii to Oahu. </p><p style="font-size: 14px;">Honolulu's ideally located port made the city a perfect stop for merchant ships traveling between North America and Asia, and through the 1800s, descendants of missionaries who arrived in the early 1800s established their headquarters in Honolulu, making it the centre of business and the main seaport for the Hawaiian Islands.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;">The late 1800s and early 1900s brought the overthrow of the Hawaiian monarchy and subsequent annexation by the United States. Under American rule, Honolulu saw the rise of tourism and the first hotels were constructed in Waikiki. American rule also brought the U.S. military, which built numerous bases in the islands, not least of which was nearby Pearl Harbor; now famous for the surprise attack by the Japanese in 1941, which brought the U.S. into World War II in the Pacific.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;">Statehood for the islands brought rapid economic growth to Honolulu, with all the state's major businesses headquartered in the city, the Honolulu airport as the primary entrance point for visitors, and Waikiki as the centre of the island's tourism industry. Statehood for the islands brought rapid economic growth to Honolulu, with all the state's major businesses headquartered in the city, the Honolulu airport as the primary entrance point for visitors, and Waikiki as the centre of the island's tourism industry.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;"><strong>3. Area &amp; Population</strong></p><p style="font-size: 14px;">Honolulu is the most remote city of its size in the world and is both the westernmost and southernmost major U.S city. According to the United States Census Bureau, the total area of Honolulu is 68.4 square miles ((177.2 km<sup>2</sup>). 60.5 square miles (156.7 km<sup>2</sup>) of it (88.44%) is land, and 7.9 square miles (20.5 km<sup>2</sup>) of it (11.56%) is water. The closest location on the mainland to Honolulu is the Point Arena Lighthouse in California, at 2,045 nautical miles (3,787 km). However, part of the Aleutian Islands of Alaska are slightly closer to Honolulu than the mainland.</p><ul style="font-size: 14px;"><li>Downtown Honolulu – the financial, commercial, and government centre of Hawaii. One of the waterfront is Aloha Tower, which for many years was the tallest building in Hawaii.

Numerous hotels, shops, and nightlife opportunities are located along Kalakaua and Kuhio Avenues. It is a popular location for visitors and locals alike and attracts millions of visitors every year. A majority of the hotel rooms on Oahu are located in Waikiki.</li></ul><p style="font-size: 14px;">The population of Honolulu is approximately 390, 738 people, where 54.8% were Asian, 17.9% were White, 1.5% were African American, 0.2% were American Indian or Alaska Native, 8.4% were Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander, and 5.4% were Hispanics and Latinos.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;"><strong>4.

Hanauma Bay is located on the very east side of Honolulu, near an area of town called Hawaii Kai. The bay, sunken into a crater with a gorgeous stretch of golden sand, is a nature reserve and marine sanctuary. Hanauma is one of the most popular tourist destinations on the Island and has suffered somewhat from overuse (at one time accommodating over three million visitors per year). In 1956, dynamite was used to clear portions of the reef to make room for telephone cables linking Hawaii to the west coast of the US.<br/>Snorkeling is the most popular activity on Hanauma Bay. Swimming just above the coral rocks and spotting amazing sea creatures is a relaxing and enjoyable way to spend the day on the island of Oahu. There is at least one company on the beach that rents snorkeling equipment and provides lessons for beginners. Even the most inexperienced snorkeler can have a great time swimming with the Hawaiian wildlife in Hanauma Bay.</li></ol><ol start="2" style="font-size: 14px;"><li><strong>Diamond Head</strong> - the iconic former volcano that stands proud at the far eastern side of Waikiki, and is often an emblem of visiting Honolulu. The volcano provides a great backdrop to all your beach photos from Waikiki, but the view is even better when you’re on the very top of it.<br/>The Diamond Head crater was formerly used as military base on Oahu, but is now open to the public for recreational use. The hike is just under a mile in length, and takes about 20 – 30 minutes to reach the summit. At first the trail is easy, then you come to a series of switchbacks where you start gaining elevation, and finally towards the end, you pass through a military tunnel, go up a few flights of stairs, and emerge through a bunker.</li></ol><ol start="3" style="font-size: 14px;"><li><strong>Honolulu Zoo</strong> – located on the east side of Waikiki, the Honolulu Zoo is the only zoo within a radius of 2,392 miles. It is also the only zoo in the United States that originated in a King’s grant of royal lands to the people. The 300 acre parcel was primarily a marshland of old fish ponds, lagoons and islands. In 1877, it was officially opened as Queen Kapiolani Park. Appointed Park Association members developed the unpromising land with the help of royal subsidies to display the King’s private bird collection and to feature a horseracing track.<br/>The modern Honolulu Zoo originated in 1984, when a second Master Plan was developed for a Tropical Zoological Garden. It organized all exhibits into three tropical ecological zones: the African Savanna, Asian and American Tropical Forests, and Pacific Islands. The zoo is spread out over 42 acres and is home to 905 different animals, most of the them natives of tropical climates. Don’t miss the komodo dragon or the orangutan!<br/>Along with the diversity of different animals at the Honolulu Zoo, the grounds are also neatly designed with many different lush tropical gardens, showcasing a variety of native Hawaiian plants and flowers.</li></ol><ol start="4" style="font-size: 14px;"><li><strong>Waikiki Aquarium</strong> - Founded in 1904 and administered by the University of Hawaii since 1919, the Waikiki Aquarium is located on the shoreline of Waikiki Beach next to a living reef and across from Kapiolani Park.

The building has been restored to its former glory and is a great place to experience Hawaiian history. The palace was the residence of Hawaii's royalty until they were deposed by American settlers in 1893. It then served as the state capitol until the modern one was constructed in 1969. The palace was restored in the 1970s and opened as a museum in 1978. The interior boasts elaborate wood paneling and carving of native woods like Koa and several imported species. The throne room still has the original carved throne and chandelier. Stained glass and elaborate decorations grace the façade.<br/>Located in the palace grounds are the Royal Barracks where the king's bodyguards lived. Originally built in 1871 close to the site of the present Hawaii State Capitol, the barracks only moved to their current position when the Capitol was built. The building resembles medieval battlements with embrasures, which appear somewhat odd in these surroundings. The palace is listed on the National Register of Historic Places</li></ol><ol start="6" style="font-size: 14px;"><li><strong>Manoa Falls &amp; Lyon Arboretum</strong> – is a waterfall located in the Manoa Valley in Honolulu.

It was on the morning of December 7th, 1941, when Japanese aircraft made a surprise bomb attack on the US ships anchored in Honolulu’s Pearl Harbor. During the deadly attack, many lives were lost, and many ships were destroyed. It was after this attack, when the US declared war on Japan and entered into World War II.<br/>When you arrive at Pearl Harbor and the USS Arizona Memorial, you get a ticket with a time on it. When it’s your turn, you meet your group and first watch a 30 minutes’ film which explains the history of what happened at Pearl Harbor.<br/>After the film, you board a ferry for a short 5 minutes’ ferry ride to the USS Arizona Memorial, which is a white platform that floats above the sunken ship.

The museum contains koa furniture and quilts as well as Emma's wedding dress.<br/>The house consists of six rooms, with the one across the back added in 1865 to accommodate the Duke of Edinburgh during his visit. The room's highlight is a Gothic curved glass cabinet given by Queen Victoria for the wedding of the royal couple. It was made in Germany from Koa logs shipped from Hawaii.<br/>The front parlour room has a round dining table in an early mission style and is one of the only pieces remaining from John Young II, a missionary who built the house and left it to Queen Emma. The 1865 baby grand piano was picked up on the royal family's grand tour of Europe. The rosewood bookcases display symbols of royalty such as a woman's feather cape and a chief's helmet made of roots. The front bedroom across the hall contains an 1842 four-poster bed made of Koa wood, a sleigh bed with a crown, and a cradle in the shape of a canoe decorated with shells. Three rooms across the middle of the house display Hawaiian feather capes, one of which contains 100,000 feathers, wooden bowls, glass, silver, jewellery, and tapa cloths. The house has been a museum since 1913 and is operated by the Daughters of Hawaii.
